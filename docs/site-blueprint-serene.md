Version: v1
Business Type: Local service (landscaping)

## Strategy
Premium local positioning for Edmonton and St. Albert, with supporting coverage in Sherwood Park and Spruce Grove. Focus on clear, human copy, strong internal linking, and intent‑matched service pages. Avoid keyword stuffing and “near me” phrasing.

### Focus Areas
1. Core service pages for high‑value keywords
2. Location‑aware copy for Edmonton and St. Albert
3. Internal link clusters (service → city, city → service)
4. Trust signals (licensed/insured, process, proof)

## Priority Services (Top 5)
1. Final Grading
2. Sod Installation
3. Paving Stones
4. Landscaping (general)
5. Snow Removal (commercial emphasis)

## Primary Service Areas
- Primary: Edmonton, St. Albert
- Secondary: Sherwood Park, Spruce Grove

---

## Keyword Strategy (Non‑Spammy)
Rule: **One page = one primary intent.**

**Per page usage guideline**
- Primary keyword: 1–2 mentions
- Secondary keyword or close variant: 1 mention
- Natural variation: 1 mention
- Total target mentions: **3–5 max**

**Placement order**
1. H1 (exact or close match)
2. First paragraph (natural)
3. One H2/H3 (variant or support)
4. One internal link anchor (clean, not stuffed)
5. Meta title/description (one clear mention)

**Avoid**
- “near me” phrasing
- stacked keywords
- repeating the exact phrase in multiple consecutive lines
