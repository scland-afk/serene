# SEO Audit: Cannibalization, Internal Linking & Keyword Stuffing

## Executive Summary

You've got solid content, but there are some SEO issues that could be holding back your rankings. The main problems? Multiple pages fighting over the same keywords, keyword repetition that feels forced, and internal linking that could be tighter. Let's fix these so Google knows exactly which page should rank for what.

---

## 1. SEO Cannibalization Issues

### The Problem

You've got three pages competing for "final grading Edmonton" and similar terms:

**Competing Pages:**
- `/services/final-grading/` — Title: "Final Grading Edmonton & Area"
- `/final-grading/st-albert/` — Title: "Final Grading St. Albert & Area"  
- `/blog/final-grading-edmonton/` — Title: "Final Grading Edmonton | New Build Requirements Guide"

When multiple pages target the same primary keyword, Google gets confused about which one deserves the top spot. Instead of one strong page ranking well, you end up with three pages splitting the vote—and none of them ranking as high as they could.

### What's Happening

Your main service page (`/services/final-grading/`) mentions Edmonton 20+ times. Your blog post also targets "Final Grading Edmonton" as the primary keyword. Meanwhile, your St. Albert page is structured almost identically, just swapping city names.

This creates what SEOs call "keyword cannibalization"—your own pages are competing against each other instead of working together.

### The Fix

**1. Clarify Primary Targets**

- **`/services/final-grading/`** → Make this the **overview page** targeting "final grading" (no city modifier). This becomes your hub page.
- **`/final-grading/st-albert/`** → Keep targeting "final grading St. Albert" (city-specific is fine).
- **`/blog/final-grading-edmonton/`** → Shift focus to **informational intent**: "Edmonton Final Grading Requirements" or "Final Grading Guide for Edmonton Homeowners". This targets people researching, not necessarily ready to buy.

**2. Differentiate Content**

Your blog post should answer questions like "What is final grading?" and "What are Edmonton's requirements?" Your service page should focus on "We do final grading" and "Here's how we help."

Right now, both pages say similar things. The blog should be educational; the service page should be conversion-focused.

**3. Use Canonical Tags (If Needed)**

If you absolutely must keep similar content, add a canonical tag pointing from the blog post to the service page. But honestly? Just differentiate the content instead.

## 2. Keyword Stuffing Analysis

### The Problem

Let's look at `/services/final-grading.html`:

- "Edmonton" appears **22 times** in the body content
- "final grading" appears **18 times** (including variations like "final grade")
- The phrase "in Edmonton" appears **8 times**

That's too much repetition. It reads like you're trying to game the algorithm instead of writing for humans.

### Specific Examples

**Overuse of "Edmonton":**
```
Line 56: "Serene Landscaping in Edmonton"
Line 59: "Final grading in Edmonton is regulated..."
Line 78: "What a Proper Final Grade Includes in Edmonton"
Line 93: "Edmonton requires final grading..."
Line 96: "many new build projects in Edmonton fall..."
Line 115: "Grading that holds up to Edmonton's seasons"
```

**Repetitive Patterns:**
- "Final grading in Edmonton" appears multiple times
- "in Edmonton" gets tacked onto sentences unnecessarily
- City name appears in headings, paragraphs, and alt text repeatedly

### The Fix

**1. Natural Keyword Distribution**

Aim for **1-2% keyword density** for your primary term. That means if your page has 1,000 words, "final grading" should appear 10-20 times naturally—not forced into every other sentence.

**2. Use Synonyms and Variations**

Instead of always saying "final grading," mix in:
- "Grading work"
- "Lot grading"
- "Site preparation"
- "Drainage grading"
- "Yard grading"

**3. Remove Unnecessary City Mentions**

You don't need "in Edmonton" in every paragraph. If the page is already about Edmonton (which it is, based on the title and URL), Google knows the location context. Use the city name when it adds value—like mentioning specific neighborhoods or local regulations.

**4. Rewrite These Sections**

**Before:**
> "Final grading in Edmonton is regulated under the City's Lot Grading Plan..."

**After:**
> "The City's Lot Grading Plan and Drainage Bylaw 18093 regulate grading work here. We shape topsoil to approved elevations..."

**Before:**
> "Edmonton requires final grading within 12 months..."

**After:**
> "The City requires grading within 12 months of rough grade approval..."

See the difference? You're still mentioning the location when it matters (local regulations), but you're not hammering it home unnecessarily.

## 3. Internal Linking Issues

### The Good News

You've got internal linking in place, which is great. But there are some opportunities to make it stronger.

### Current Linking Patterns

**What's Working:**
- Service pages link to related services (final grading → sod installation)
- Location pages link to service pages
- You're using keyword-rich anchor text (mostly)

**What Needs Work:**

**1. Too Many Links on Some Pages**

Your `/services/final-grading.html` page has:
- 4 links in the "Related Services" section
- Multiple in-body links to other services
- Links to location pages
- Links in the FAQ section

That's probably 10+ internal links on one page. While there's no hard limit, too many links dilute the value of each link. Focus on linking to your **most important pages** with **the most relevant anchor text**.

**2. Inconsistent Anchor Text**

**Good Examples:**
- "final grading in St. Albert" → `/final-grading/st-albert/`
- "sod installation" → `/services/sod-installation/`

**Needs Improvement:**
- Generic "See our service area pages" followed by city names
- "For city-specific details" links that don't use keyword-rich text

**3. Missing Strategic Links**

Your blog post about final grading Edmonton should link to:
- Your main `/services/final-grading/` page (with anchor "final grading services")
- Your `/locations/edmonton/` page (with anchor "landscaping in Edmonton")

Right now, it links to the service page, but the anchor text could be stronger.

### The Fix

**1. Prioritize Your Links**

On each page, identify your **3-5 most important internal links**. These should be:
- Your primary service pages
- Your main location pages
- Pages that support the user journey

Everything else? Either remove it or move it to a less prominent position (like the footer).

**2. Improve Anchor Text**

**Before:**
> "See our service area pages: [Edmonton], [St. Albert], [Sherwood Park]"

**After:**
> "We serve Edmonton, St. Albert, and Sherwood Park. Learn more about our [landscaping services in Edmonton], [St. Albert landscaping], and [Sherwood Park services]."

**3. Create a Clear Link Hierarchy**

- **Homepage** → Links to main service pages (final grading, sod installation, hardscaping)
- **Service pages** → Link to related services + main location pages
- **Location pages** → Link to city-specific service pages + homepage
- **Blog posts** → Link to relevant service pages + location pages

**4. Use Contextual Links**

Instead of a generic "Related Services" section, weave links naturally into your content:

**Before:**
> "Final grading is completed before sod installation or a full landscape design build."

**After:**
> "Final grading is completed before [sod installation] or a full [landscape design] build."

The link is there, but it feels natural—not like you're forcing it in.

## 4. Additional Recommendations

### Content Differentiation

Your location pages (`/locations/edmonton.html`, `/locations/st-albert.html`) are well-structured, but make sure each one has **unique content** beyond just swapping city names. The docs mention you've already worked on this, which is good—just keep an eye on it.

### Title Tag Optimization

Some of your title tags are getting long. Google typically displays 50-60 characters, so keep them concise:

**Current:**
> "Final Grading Edmonton & Area | Serene Landscaping" (54 chars - okay)

**Could Be:**
> "Final Grading Edmonton | Serene Landscaping" (47 chars - tighter)

The "& Area" is implied—you don't need it in every title.

### Meta Description Review

Your descriptions are solid, but some are repetitive. Each page should have a unique value proposition:

**Current Pattern:**
> "Professional [service] in Edmonton, St. Albert, and Sherwood Park. [Features]. Free quotes today. Call 587-566-9879."

This works, but consider varying the structure so Google doesn't see them as duplicate content.

## Final Thoughts

Your content is solid, and you've clearly put thought into SEO. The issues here are common—most sites deal with cannibalization and keyword overuse at some point. The good news? These are fixable problems.

Focus on making each page serve a distinct purpose. Your service pages should convert; your blog posts should educate. Your location pages should target local searches; your main service pages should target broader terms.

Once you clarify these roles, the keyword usage and internal linking will fall into place naturally. You'll have a cleaner site structure, and Google will have an easier time understanding which page deserves to rank for which query.

Remember: SEO isn't about gaming the system. It's about making your site easy for both users and search engines to understand. Fix these issues, and you'll see better rankings—not because you tricked the algorithm, but because you made your site genuinely better.
