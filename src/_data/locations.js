        q: "What work do you handle most often in Edmonton?",
        a: "In newer areas like Secord and McConachie, it is usually final grading and sod to finish the yard properly. In established neighborhoods, the most common projects are lawn replacement, patio and walkway upgrades, and targeted fixes that improve the property without rebuilding everything. We quote each job based on what actually needs to be done, not a standard package price."
      },
      {
        q: "Do you work in new developments like Secord and McConachie?",
        a: "Yes. We regularly work in new development areas including Secord, McConachie, Windermere, and Summerside for final grading, sod, and yard completion. We also take on renovation projects across established Edmonton neighborhoods like Riverbend, Mill Woods, and West Edmonton. If your property is in Edmonton, we can provide a free quote after a site visit."
      },
      {
        q: "Can a landscaping project be done in phases?",
        a: "Yes. Many Edmonton clients start with grading or a lawn replacement, then add patios, walkways, or other upgrades later. We plan phases so each stage finishes cleanly and sets up the next step without paying twice for the same prep work. This approach spreads costs over time and lets you see our work quality before committing to larger phases."
      },
      {
        q: "How do you price landscaping projects in Edmonton?",
        a: "Pricing depends on the scope of work, site access, materials, and what needs to be removed or rebuilt. We provide free on-site quotes after visiting your Edmonton property so the scope is clear and the pricing is accurate. You get straightforward numbers based on the real work required, not a quick estimate over the phone."
      },
      {
        q: "How soon can you start in Edmonton?",
        a: "Timing depends on the type of project and the season. Smaller work like lawn replacement can often be scheduled within 1 to 2 weeks. Larger builds and hardscaping require planning, material ordering, and crew scheduling, typically 2 to 4 weeks out. We provide a realistic start window after the site visit so you can plan accordingly. Rush jobs may be available depending on current workload."
      },
      {
        q: "Do you offer free quotes in Edmonton?",
        a: "Yes. We provide free on-site quotes for all Edmonton properties with a clear scope of work, timeline expectations, and straightforward pricing. We visit your property, measure the work areas, review what needs to be done, and provide accurate numbers. No pressure, no sales pitch. Call 587-566-9879 to schedule a site visit."

    intro:
      "St. Albert homeowners take pride in their properties. The expectation is simple: clean work, correct finish and a yard that looks right for the neighborhood. Serene Landscaping provides full landscaping services in St. Albert, including grading, sod, hardscaping and ongoing maintenance. In areas like Erin Ridge and Riverside, we often help homeowners finish new yards properly. In established neighborhoods like Braeside and Lacombe Park, we focus on upgrades that improve curb appeal and function without turning the property into a long project.",

    faqs: [
      {
        q: "Do you work in newer St. Albert communities like Erin Ridge?",
        a: "Yes. We regularly work in Erin Ridge, Riverside, and other newer St. Albert communities for grading, sod, and complete yard builds. Many new builds in these areas come without finished yards, so homeowners hire us to complete the grading, install sod, and add patios or walkways. Projects typically start 2 to 4 weeks after signing the contract, depending on season and scope."
      },
      {
        q: "Why do many St. Albert projects start with grading?",
        a: "Because final grading prevents rework later and sets the yard up correctly before finishing work begins. St. Albert building codes require proper drainage and slope away from your foundation. If grading is done wrong or skipped, you end up paying twice. Once to remove the bad work and again to do it right. Starting with professional grading means sod, patios, and landscaping go in clean the first time."
      },
      {
        q: "Can you upgrade an older St. Albert yard without rebuilding everything?",
        a: "Yes. Many St. Albert projects in Braeside and Oakmont start with a lawn replacement or patio upgrade, then expand from there as budget allows. This staged approach keeps the property functional while upgrades happen one zone at a time. We plan phases so each area finishes completely before moving to the next, avoiding a half-done yard for months."
      },
      {
        q: "Do you handle patios and walkways?",
        a: "Yes. Patios and walkways are common upgrades in St. Albert neighborhoods like Oakmont, Braeside, and Lacombe Park. We build with proper base prep so hardscaping stays level and tight through freeze-thaw cycles. Projects typically cost $5,000 to $15,000 depending on size and materials. We provide detailed quotes after visiting your property and reviewing the work area."
      },
      {
        q: "Do you offer free quotes?",
        a: "Yes. All St. Albert quotes are done on site so the scope and pricing are accurate. We measure the work area, review what needs to be done, and provide straightforward pricing with realistic timelines. No pressure, no sales games. Just clear information so you can make the right decision for your property."
      },
      {
        q: "Can work be done in phases?",
        a: "Yes. Many St. Albert families prefer phased work so the project fits their timing and budget without overextending. We break the job into logical stages. Grading first, then sod, then patios or walkways later. Each phase finishes cleanly without leaving the yard torn up for months. We plan the entire project upfront so you understand the full scope before committing to anything."

    intro:
      "Sherwood Park has many established homes with larger lots. Most owners are not looking to start from scratch. They want their yard to look sharper, work better and match the home. Serene Landscaping helps Sherwood Park homeowners upgrade lawns, patios and outdoor spaces with practical improvements that make a clear difference. In neighborhoods like Lakeland Ridge and Summerwood, we are often brought in for lawn replacement and clean hardscape upgrades. In more established areas like Brentwood, we focus on renovations that respect what is already there while modernizing the layout and finish.",

      {
        q: "What is the most common Sherwood Park project you do?",
        a: "Lawn replacement and patio upgrades are the most common starters. Many Sherwood Park properties in Lakeland Ridge and Brentwood have older lawns that need a full reset, or patios that have settled and need a rebuild. Most projects run $2,500 to $8,000 depending on scope. Clients often start with one area, see the result, then expand to other zones later."
      },
      {
        q: "Do you work in Lakeland Ridge and Summerwood?",
        a: "Yes. We serve all of Sherwood Park including Lakeland Ridge, Summerwood, and Brentwood. We work on both larger established lots and newer properties throughout the area. If your property is in Sherwood Park, we can quote it. Call 587-566-9879 or request a free site visit."
      },
      {
        q: "Can you improve the yard without rebuilding everything?",
        a: "Yes. Many jobs start with one zone such as a new lawn or patio, then expand later. This approach keeps the project manageable and lets you see the quality before committing to a full renovation. We plan each phase so it finishes cleanly and sets up the next step without paying twice for prep work. Most Sherwood Park clients prefer this staged approach."
      },
      {
        q: "Do you work on larger lots?",
        a: "Yes. Sherwood Park has many larger properties, especially in areas like Brentwood and along range roads. We quote based on the real scope of work, not a quick estimate. Larger lots require more material, more labor, and better planning. We provide accurate quotes after visiting the site and measuring the work area."
      },
      {
        q: "Do you offer free quotes?",
        a: "Yes. We provide free on-site quotes for all Sherwood Park properties. We visit your property, measure the work areas, review what needs to be done, and provide straightforward pricing with a clear scope. No pressure, no sales pitch. Just accurate information so you can make an informed decision. Call 587-566-9879 to schedule a site visit."
      },
      {
        q: "Can you handle both hardscaping and landscaping in one project?",
        a: "Yes. Many Sherwood Park projects combine lawn work with patios, walkways, or retaining walls. This approach makes sense when multiple areas need work. We handle all phases of the job so you work with one contractor from start to finish. Projects typically take 1 to 3 weeks depending on scope and weather conditions."
