                    Finish your new build yard properly. Final grading is the foundation of every new construction project in Edmonton, St. Albert, Spruce Grove, and Sherwood Park. We complete grading to meet building code requirements and ensure proper drainage away from your foundation. Our project managers shoot elevations based on your Real Property Report, saving you money by avoiding third-party surveyor costs.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We work on both greenfield and infill projects and understand the new infill final grade requirements. Our strong understanding of final grade requirements allows us to help you find the most cost-effective way to deal with unique drainage plans. Unlike many landscape companies, we complete the entire project before final grade inspection to save you time and money. This ensures your property drains correctly even after the project is finished, and lets your family start enjoying the yard sooner.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Proper site preparation is crucial for successful landscaping projects. We provide final grading and topsoil preparation throughout Greater Edmonton, ensuring proper drainage and preparing the ground for healthy plant growth. Final grading is often required before <a href="/services/landscape-design/">landscape design</a>, <a href="/services/lawn-maintenance/">sod installation</a>, or <a href="/services/hardscaping/">hardscaping</a>. We guarantee final grade approval because we know what inspectors are looking for and how to ensure your grade will pass inspection.

                    Proper drainage prevents water issues and protects your foundation. Our grading ensures water flows away from your house and toward appropriate drainage areas. We prepare the ground properly so your landscaping will thrive and your property will drain correctly for years to come. Our small and large skid steers allow us to compact and move topsoil efficiently in most yards to reduce settling. This attention to detail prevents future problems and ensures your investment pays off.
