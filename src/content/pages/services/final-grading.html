                </h1>
                <p>
                    Final grading shapes your yard so water drains away from the foundation and the lot is ready for landscaping. <a href="/">Serene Landscaping in Edmonton</a> provides final grading for new construction, drainage correction, and full yard preparation across neighborhoods Secord, McConachie, Heritage Valley, Windermere, and Riverbend.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The City of Edmonton’s Lot Grading Plan and Drainage Bylaw 18093 set the rules for final grading and inspections. We shape topsoil to approved elevations, preserve swales, and build a 2% slope away from the foundation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Final grade approval includes an as-built Lot Grading Certificate, City inspection, and a pass or fail result. If deficiencies are found, corrections are required and a re-inspection must be booked. Inspections are completed within 10 business days.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Final grading is completed before <a href="/services/sod-installation/">sod installation</a> or a full <a href="/services/landscape-design/">landscape design</a> build.
                </p>

                    What a Proper Final Grade Includes
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We check elevations at the house, fence line, and lot corners, and keep swales open. Soil is raked smooth, compacted, and rolled to reduce settlement. Transitions to sidewalks sit about 1/2" above concrete, and we grade around downspouts so water doesn’t pool at the foundation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Common inspection failures include negative slope toward the foundation, blocked swales, and loose or uneven topsoil. We correct these before inspection to avoid re-inspection fees.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Under Drainage Bylaw 18093, owners are responsible for final grade approval and maintaining approved grades. Settlement or landscaping changes that affect drainage must be corrected.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Timelines and Pricing
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The City requires final grading within 12 months of rough grade approval, or within 30 months of the building permit issuance. Most residential final grading jobs take 1-2 days once material is on site.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Final grading ranges from $1,500 to $3,500 depending on lot size, access, and how much topsoil is required. If you are doing grading and sod together, many new build projects in Edmonton fall in the $3,000 to $8,000 range. We provide a clear scope after a site visit.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you have a lot plan or previous grade notes from a builder, we work from those targets to keep grades consistent.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We can haul off excess soil and plan around tight access. Before inspection, the site should be accessible, clear, and smoothly graded.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Final Grading in St. Albert
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Unlike Edmonton, the City of St. Albert does not require a final grade inspection or certificate. However, grading must remain consistent with the original lot design established under the City's Municipal Engineering Standards. We shape topsoil to protect swales, avoid negative drainage, and prepare the site for sod installation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Swale preservation is critical in St. Albert. Many lots include shared grass swales between homes or rear swales in Utility Right-of-Way areas. These must remain open, properly sloped, and free of debris. Sump pump discharge must also follow the City of St. Albert Surface Drainage Bylaw requirements, and we grade around discharge points to prevent erosion and maintain required setbacks.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Common St. Albert grading projects involve protecting swales on new builds, correcting settlement around foundations, and fixing low spots caused by landscaping changes. We work throughout St. Albert in neighborhoods like <strong>Erin Ridge</strong>, <strong>Jensen Lakes</strong>, <strong>Oakmont</strong>, <strong>Braeside</strong>, <strong>Lacombe Park</strong>, and <strong>Riverside</strong>.

                        A typical residential lot ranges from $1,500 to $3,500 depending on lot size, access, and site conditions. If grading and sod are done together, many Edmonton projects fall in the $3,000 to $8,000 range.
