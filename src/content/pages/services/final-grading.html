                </h1>
                <p>
                    Final grading is the process of shaping and leveling your yard to ensure proper drainage away from your foundation. It is required for new construction homes, major renovations, and properties with drainage issues. Without proper grading, water pools near foundations, landscaping fails to establish, and long-term damage occurs.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We provide final grading services throughout Greater Edmonton, including Edmonton, St. Albert, Sherwood Park, Spruce Grove, and Stony Plain. Our work includes topsoil placement, slope correction, swale preservation, and preparation for sod or landscaping installation. We work on both new construction and existing properties that need drainage correction.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Final grading is often required before <a href="/services/landscape-design/">landscape design</a>, <a href="/services/sod-installation/">sod installation</a>, or <a href="/services/hardscaping/">hardscaping</a> can begin. Proper site preparation prevents rework and ensures your landscaping investment performs correctly from the start.

                </h2>
                <h3>
                    Common Final Grading Situations
                </h3>
                <p>
                    <strong>New Construction Homes:</strong> Most municipalities require final grading approval before occupancy or within a set timeframe after possession. New builds in developments like Secord, McConachie, Heritage Valley, Windermere, Erin Ridge, and Jensen Lakes typically need professional grading to meet code requirements.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Drainage Problems:</strong> Properties with water pooling near foundations, soggy yards, or basement moisture issues often need grading correction to redirect water flow.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Landscape Preparation:</strong> Before sod, patios, or plantings can be installed, the grade must be correct. Poor grading leads to uneven lawns, settling hardscaping, and plant failure.

                        Final grading is typically required for new construction homes, major landscaping projects, or when addressing drainage issues. Most municipalities require final grade approval within a set timeframe after possession. It ensures proper slope and drainage before installing landscaping features.

                        Final grading costs depend on lot size, access, and site conditions. A typical residential lot ranges from $900 to $2,500 depending on the amount of correction needed. Difficult access, slopes, or drainage work will affect pricing. We provide free on-site consultations and detailed quotes with clear scope and timeline.

                        Rough grading involves initial earth moving and shaping, typically done during construction. Final grading is the finishing work that prepares the site for landscaping, including topsoil placement, slope correction, and ensuring proper drainage patterns.
