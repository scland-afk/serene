                <p>
                    Final grading shapes your yard so water drains away from the foundation and the lot is ready for landscaping. <a href="/">Serene Landscaping in Edmonton</a> provides final grading for new construction, drainage correction, and full yard preparation across neighborhoods like Riverbend, Terwillegar, and Windermere.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Proper grading is the foundation for everything that follows. We shoot grades with a laser level and build 2% slope away from the foundation—that's about a 2" drop over 8 feet. Topsoil goes down 4-6" deep for sod. On clay-heavy lots, we may add drain tile to move water faster.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Final grading is commonly completed before <a href="/services/sod-installation/">sod installation</a> or a full <a href="/services/landscape-design/">landscape design</a> build. With over 8 years of local experience, we plan grades that perform well for Edmonton properties.

                    What a Proper Final Grade Includes in Edmonton
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We check elevations at the house, fence line, and lot corners. Soil gets raked smooth and rolled to avoid settling. Transitions to sidewalks sit 1/2" above concrete so sod doesn't get scalped by mowers.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Timelines and Pricing
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Most residential final grading jobs take 1-2 days once material is on site. Tight access, heavy corrections, or large lots can extend timelines. Final grading typically ranges from $1,500 to $3,500 depending on lot size, access, and how much topsoil is required.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We provide a clear scope after a site visit so you know what is included before we start. If you plan to install sod or hardscape next, we can coordinate the schedule so the yard moves from grade to finish without delays.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you have a lot plan or previous grade notes from a builder, we can work from those targets to keep grades consistent. We also flag problem areas early so any drainage fixes are built into the plan instead of added later.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We can haul off excess soil if required, and we plan around tight access when needed.
                </p>
