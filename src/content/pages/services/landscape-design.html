                <p>
                    We meet on-site to confirm your goals, timeline, and the vision for your outdoor space. We review layout, drainage, access, and existing conditions so the plan fits the real site. You receive a detailed plan outlining the work, materials, and scope before we build.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We provide clear pricing and a defined scope so expectations are set before moving forward. Our crew completes the work according to plan while keeping the site organized and communication clear. We review the finished project with you and confirm everything meets expectations before closeout.
