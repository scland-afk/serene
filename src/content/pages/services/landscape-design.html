                </h1>
                <p>
                    Serene Landscaping provides professional landscape design and construction across Edmonton, St. Albert, Spruce Grove, and Sherwood Park. We've done full backyard builds in Windermere, front yard refreshes in St. Albert, and everything in between. Each project starts with a site walk and ends with a clear materials list and scope.
                </p>
                <p>
                    From patios and walkways to planting, grading, and sod, our team handles the full design‑build scope. We spec Unilock and Belgard pavers, source local sod from Alberta farms, and grade every yard to drain away from the house.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We've completed 200+ landscape projects across the region. We know which plants survive here, how deep to set a patio base, and where water pools if grades aren't right.
                </p>

                    Cost and Timing for Landscape Design in Edmonton
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Design work is often bundled with the build. We do a site visit, talk through your goals and budget, then provide a plan and a quote for the full job. That way you see the full picture before committing. Design-only consultations are available if you want a layout and materials list to use later or with another contractor.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Full design-build projects range from a few thousand for a focused upgrade to tens of thousands for a complete yard. We break large projects into phases when it makes sense so you can spread cost and see results at each step. Timeline depends on scope; we give a realistic schedule in the quote.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Design That Fits How You Live
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Every property is different. We measure the lot, check existing grades with a laser level, and note where water sits after rain. Then we design around how you actually use the space—where the kids play, where you want to sit, where the grill goes.
                </p>
