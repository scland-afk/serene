                </h1>
                <p>
                    Serene Landscaping provides professional landscape design and construction in Edmonton, St. Albert, Spruce Grove, and Sherwood Park. We've done full backyard builds in Windermere, front yard refreshes in St. Albert, and everything in between. Each project starts with a site walk and ends with a clear materials list and scope.
                </p>
                <p>
                    From patios and walkways to planting, grading, and sod, our team handles the full design‑build process. We spec Unilock and Belgard pavers, source local sod from Alberta farms, and grade every yard to drain away from the house.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We've completed 200+ landscape projects across Greater Edmonton. We know which plants survive here, how deep to set a patio base, and where water pools if grades aren't right.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Every property is different. We measure the lot, check existing grades with a laser level, and note where water sits after rain. Then we design around how you actually use the space—where the kids play, where you want to sit, where the grill goes.
