                    Upgrade your outdoor space with professional hardscaping services built for long-term performance.

                <p>
                    Our hardscaping services include interlocking paver patios, circular patio designs, retaining walls, fire pits, and outdoor structures. For many of our clients in Secord, patios are the finishing touch after grading and sod. In older areas, upgrades are a practical way to improve existing yards.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We serve residential and commercial properties throughout Greater Edmonton. Our crew understands what it takes to build hardscaping that performs properly over time. We do not cut corners on base work because that is what keeps patios and walkways from settling and shifting.

                    We work with Unilock, Belgard, and Techno-Bloc pavers based on design goals and budget. Bases are excavated 6 to 8 inches, then built with 4 to 6 inches of road crush and topped with 1 to 2 inches of limestone screening, compacted in 2-inch lifts using a plate compactor. Retaining walls use Allan Block or Expocrete systems, with geogrid installed on walls over three feet. Joints are finished with polymeric sand, and edge restraints are staked every 12 inches to keep surfaces stable.
                </p>

                        Hardscaping timelines depend on scope and complexity. A simple walkway may take 2 to 3 days, while a large patio with retaining walls can take 1 to 2 weeks. We provide detailed timelines during the consultation.

Retaining walls average around $60 per square foot, though pricing varies based on the type of materials used. We design and build retaining walls using quality materials and proper engineering techniques for properties throughout the region.
