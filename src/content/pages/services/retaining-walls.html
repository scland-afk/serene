                <p>
                    Retaining walls Edmonton homes need must hold grade, manage water pressure, and stay stable through freeze-thaw cycles. That requires proper base preparation, drainage systems, and correctly installed materials.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At Serene Landscaping, we build retaining walls for grade changes, slope stabilization, and tiered garden beds across Edmonton and nearby communities. We focus on structure first, because appearance means nothing if the wall shifts or fails.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Whether your project manages drainage on a sloped yard or creates level space for a patio, we engineer the foundation so your wall performs correctly and lasts.
                </p>

                <h2>
                    Retaining Walls Edmonton for Slope Stabilization and Usable Space
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Most projects address grade changes between properties, create level areas for patios or lawns, or replace failing walls from previous installations. We also build tiered garden beds and raised planting areas. We walk the property with you to review slope, drainage, soil conditions, and wall height requirements before construction. That planning step determines materials, permits, and timelines.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Our Retaining Wall Installation Process
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A stable wall starts with proper excavation and a compacted granular base. We install drainage systems behind the wall to manage water pressure, because hydrostatic pressure is what causes walls to bow and fail. Blocks are leveled, pinned, and backfilled in lifts with free-draining material—not clay or topsoil.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Site Assessment + Engineering:</strong> We measure grade change, evaluate soil conditions, and determine if permits are required for wall height.</li>
                    <li><strong>Base Preparation:</strong> We excavate to proper depth, install compacted granular base, and ensure the first course sits level and below grade.</li>
                    <li><strong>Drainage Installation:</strong> Perforated drain tile runs behind the wall, wrapped in filter fabric, and outlets to daylight or stormwater systems.</li>
                    <li><strong>Block Installation:</strong> Each course is leveled, pinned with fiberglass or metal pins, and backfilled with clear stone in 8-inch lifts.</li>
                    <li><strong>Cap Installation + Grading:</strong> Capstones are glued in place, and final grading directs water away from the wall face.</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>
                    What Affects Cost and Timing
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Pricing depends on wall height, linear footage, site access, soil conditions, and whether permits are required. Walls over 4 feet typically require engineering stamps and inspections. After a site visit, we provide a detailed written quote outlining scope, materials, timelines, and any permit coordination.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Retaining Wall Materials and Longevity
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We primarily install Allan Block and similar segmental retaining wall systems designed for freeze-thaw performance. These interlock without mortar, allow controlled movement, and can be repaired or adjusted if needed. Natural stone walls are available for specific design requirements but require different installation methods.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Properly installed segmental walls last 30+ years. Failures typically result from inadequate drainage, poor base compaction, or insufficient embedment depth—not block failure.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Long-Term Performance Through Proper Installation
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Results depend on engineering, not just appearance. We focus on correct base depth (minimum 6 inches of compacted ¾" clear stone), drainage that outlets properly, and backfill that allows water to move through—not around—the wall. Clean grading at the top prevents surface water from running behind the wall and creating pressure.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Retaining Walls in St. Albert
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We install retaining walls throughout St. Albert in neighborhoods like Erin Ridge, Braeside, Lacombe Park, Deer Ridge, Riverside, and Grandin. Recent projects include a 45-foot tiered wall in Erin Ridge creating patio space, slope stabilization in Braeside along a property line, and garden bed walls in Deer Ridge.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Retaining walls in St. Albert generally range from $45 to $85 per square foot of wall face depending on height, access, and drainage requirements. Walls over 4 feet require engineering and permits, which add to project timelines. We provide detailed written quotes after assessing your site.

                        In most Edmonton-area municipalities, walls over 4 feet (1.2m) in height require building permits and engineered drawings. We coordinate permit applications and inspections as part of the project.

                        Three factors prevent failure: proper base depth and compaction, drainage systems that manage water pressure behind the wall, and backfill material that allows water to drain through. Most wall failures result from inadequate drainage or poor base preparation.

                        Yes. We install retaining walls throughout St. Albert, including Erin Ridge, Braeside, Lacombe Park, Deer Ridge, and Riverside. Walls generally range from $45 to $85 per square foot depending on height and site conditions.

                        Segmental retaining walls are low maintenance. Keep drainage outlets clear, prevent soil buildup at the base, and check for settling or movement annually. Well-built walls require minimal intervention.

Walls over 4 feet require engineering and permits, which add cost and timeline. We provide detailed quotes after a site assessment."}},
        {"@type": "Question", "name": "Do I need a permit for a retaining wall?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "In most Edmonton-area municipalities, walls over 4 feet (1.2m) in height require building permits and engineered drawings. We coordinate permit applications and inspections as part of the project."}},
        {"@type": "Question", "name": "How long does retaining wall installation take?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "Most residential walls take 3–7 days depending on length, height, and site conditions. Permit approval adds 2–4 weeks to the timeline before construction starts."}},

Natural stone walls require mortar, skilled masonry work, and don't flex with ground movement. We recommend segmental systems for most residential applications."}},
