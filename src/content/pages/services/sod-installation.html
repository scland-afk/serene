                    Sod Installation Services
                </h1>
                <p>
                    We install rolled turf for new lawns and full yard replacements. Whether you're finishing a new build after <a href="/services/final-grading/">final grading</a>, redoing a tired lawn, or adding grass where there wasn't any, we handle the base, the rollout, and the aftercare so the lawn takes hold and lasts.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Rolled sod gives you green coverage right away instead of waiting weeks for seed. The trade-off is cost and timing: sod needs the right base and a clear watering plan. We focus on both so the lawn doesn't just look good at first—it roots in and holds up.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The difference between a lawn that sticks and one that browns or bumps is the base. We check drainage and grade, prep soil to the right depth, and lay sod with tight seams and a layout that sheds water. You get a written watering schedule for the first few weeks so roots establish without guesswork.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We offer this service across the Greater Edmonton region.
