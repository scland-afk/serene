                <p>
    Sod installation Edmonton projects succeed when the base is prepared properly for strong rooting and even growth. Without the right soil depth, grading, and drainage, even high-quality sod can struggle to establish.
</p>
<p>
    At Serene Landscaping, we install fresh sod for new lawns and full turf replacements across Edmonton and nearby communities. We focus on preparation first, because that foundation determines how well your lawn takes root.
</p>
<p>
    Whether your project follows final grading on a new build or replaces worn-out grass, we build a proper soil base so roots establish quickly and grow consistently.
</p>

<h2>
    Sod Installation Edmonton for New Builds and Lawn Replacements
</h2>
<p>
    Many projects follow <a href="/services/final-grading/">final grading</a>, but we also replace existing lawns, correct uneven yards, and rebuild lawns that never properly took. We walk the property with you to review drainage, access, and preparation needs before installation. That planning step helps keep the process smooth and avoids unexpected issues.
</p>
<h2>
    Our Sod Installation Process
</h2>
<p>
    A healthy lawn starts below the surface. We install 4–6 inches of screened topsoil, grade and roll it smooth, then lay a Kentucky bluegrass blend the same day it is cut. Seams are staggered like brickwork and fitted tightly, because gaps dry out and leave visible lines.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Site Walk + Plan:</strong> We confirm grading, drainage, access, and the right installation approach for your yard.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Base Prep:</strong> We level and roll the topsoil, correct low and high spots, and cut clean edges along patios and garden beds.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Sod Layout:</strong> Tight seams, staggered joints, and clean edges help reduce drying and shrinkage.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Roll + Water:</strong> We roll the sod for full soil contact, then provide a clear watering plan.
    </li>
</ul>
<h2>
    What Affects Cost and Timing
</h2>
<p>
    Pricing depends on yard size, preparation requirements, site access, and whether the project involves new construction or lawn replacement. After a site visit, we provide a clear written quote outlining scope, materials, and timelines.
</p>
<h2>
    Aftercare That Helps Your Lawn Establish
</h2>
<p>
    We provide simple guidance for watering and mowing so your sod roots properly and stays healthy. For ongoing care and seasonal cleanups, explore our <a href="/services/lawn-maintenance/">lawn maintenance</a> services.
</p>
<h2>
    New Lawn Installation That Looks Clean and Lasts
</h2>
<p>
    Long-term results come from proper preparation. We focus on smooth grades, clean edges along patios and fences, and consistent soil depth so your turf installation looks even and drains correctly.
</p>
<h2>
    Sod Installation in St. Albert
</h2>
<p>
    We install sod throughout St. Albert in neighborhoods like <strong>Erin Ridge</strong>, <strong>Jensen Lakes</strong>, <strong>Braeside</strong>, <strong>Lacombe Park</strong>, <strong>Deer Ridge</strong>, and <strong>Riverside</strong>.

</p>
<p>

<h2>
    Cost and Timing for Sod Installation in Edmonton
</h2>
<p>
    Sod is typically priced per square foot installed, including prep, delivery, and placement. Most new-build or replacement lawns in the Edmonton area run from about $1.50 to $2.50 per square foot depending on soil work and access. We quote after measuring the area and checking grade so the number is accurate.
</p>
<p>
    Installation usually takes one to two days for an average yard. We schedule when the ground is workable and the forecast is clear so the sod roots in properly. You will get simple aftercare instructions so the lawn establishes evenly.
