                    Improve privacy, security, and curb appeal with professional fence installation across Edmonton, St. Albert, Spruce Grove, and Sherwood Park. We build fences that stay straight, secure, and stable through Edmonton's cold weather.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our crew handles layout, post setting, and clean finishing from start to finish. Fence posts are set three feet deep in concrete. Anything shallower is likely to shift or lean over time. We string reference lines and use laser levels so panels stay straight and gates operate smoothly.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We install new fences, gates, and repairs for both residential and commercial properties. Whether you need a privacy fence, a side-yard boundary, or an upgrade to existing panels, we keep the work organized and the results consistent.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    Fence cost depends on length, height, material, and whether we are replacing old fence or building new. Cedar costs more than pressure-treated; vinyl sits in the middle. We measure on site and quote line by line so you see where the number comes from. Most residential fence projects in Edmonton run from about $35 to $55 per linear foot installed, depending on style and material.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A typical backyard fence takes a few days to a week. We set posts first and let concrete cure before hanging panels so nothing shifts. Gates get extra bracing and heavy-duty hardware so they stay straight. We coordinate with neighbors when the fence is on a shared line so there are no surprises.

                <p>
                    Posts set at 3 feet in concrete stay put. We use pressure-treated 4x4s or 6x6s depending on fence height, and galvanized hardware throughout. Gates get heavy-duty hinges and self-closing latches that don't stick.
