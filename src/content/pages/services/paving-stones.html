                    Paving stones Edmonton homeowners choose should be built on a solid base with correct slope and tight joints. Our crew installs patios, walkways, and driveways with clean edges so pavers stay level and durable under daily traffic.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Paving Stones Edmonton Projects for Homes
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We build front entry walkways, side yard paths, patio extensions, and full backyard patios. Many projects include steps, border courses, and lighting sleeves so future upgrades are easy. Popular paver patterns include running bond, herringbone, and three-piece random layouts.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Base Prep and Installation
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Long-term performance comes from the base. We excavate 8-10", install 6-8" of 20mm road crush or limestone screening, and compact in 2" lifts. Pavers sit on 1" of bedding sand, get cut tight to edges, and are locked in with polymeric sand and edge restraints staked every 12".
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Paver Styles and Layouts
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Pavers come in a wide range of sizes, textures, and colors so you can match your home and landscape. We regularly install three-piece random patterns, herringbone, and running bond layouts. Borders can be added as soldier courses or contrasting bands to frame patios and walkways cleanly.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We set the layout before cutting so joint lines stay consistent and patterns land evenly. This avoids thin slivers at edges and keeps the surface looking balanced once everything is compacted.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Driveways and Heavy-Use Areas
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For driveways or high-traffic zones, we use thicker pavers and build a deeper base to handle vehicle loads. Proper compaction and edge restraint are critical so the field does not spread over time. We set slope for runoff and keep transitions flush at garage slabs and sidewalks.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Maintenance and Repairs
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Paving stones are easy to maintain. If a section ever settles, individual pavers can be lifted, the base adjusted, and the stones reset. Polymeric sand in the joints helps reduce weed growth and keeps the surface locked. We can return for re-sanding or leveling if needed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Occasional sweeping and a light rinse keeps patios looking clean. If you choose to seal the surface, we can recommend a schedule based on use and sun exposure. For winter care, use plastic shovels and avoid metal blades that can chip edges.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Proper edge restraint and consistent joint spacing are what keep pavers tight over time. We focus on the details at borders, steps, and transitions so the layout stays locked even with regular foot traffic.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you plan lighting or future features, we can leave sleeves under the patio and set clean transition points. This keeps upgrades simple without cutting into the finished pavers.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Project Timelines
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Smaller patios and walkways usually take 2-3 days from excavation to final sweep. Larger patios with borders and steps can take 4-6 days. Driveways typically run 5-7 days depending on size and access. We provide a clear schedule before we start.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We confirm access for skid steer or wheelbarrow runs before the start date. Permits are not usually required for patios, but we can flag any issues if needed.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Why Choose Paving Stones
                </h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Clean finishes:</strong> Crisp edges around gardens, steps, and patios.</li>
                    <li><strong>Easy repairs:</strong> Individual pavers can be lifted and reset.</li>
                    <li><strong>Design flexibility:</strong> Shapes, colors, and patterns that match your home.</li>
                    <li><strong>Drainage control:</strong> Proper slope keeps water moving away from foundations.</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>
                    Typical Paving Stone Costs
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Most paving stone patios range from $35 to $45 per square foot depending on access, pattern, and border details. We provide clear quotes after a site visit so you know the exact scope, materials, and timeline.

                <h2>
                    Paving Stones in St. Albert
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We install paving stones throughout St. Albert in neighborhoods like <strong>Braeside</strong>, <strong>Lacombe Park</strong>, <strong>Riverside</strong>, <strong>Erin Ridge</strong>, <strong>Oakmont</strong>, and <strong>Jensen Lakes</strong>. Our installations are built to handle Alberta's freeze-thaw cycles with proper base depth and compaction.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Paving stones offer better long-term performance than stamped concrete, with fewer repairs and higher visual impact. If a section ever shifts or gets damaged, individual stones can be adjusted or replaced without tearing everything out.
