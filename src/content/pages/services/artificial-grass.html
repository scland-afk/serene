                <p>
                    Enjoy a green, clean lawn with professional artificial grass installation across Edmonton, St. Albert, Spruce Grove, and Sherwood Park. Synthetic turf is a low‑maintenance solution for busy households, pet areas, and outdoor spaces that need to look great year‑round.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We handle site preparation, base work, and drainage so your turf looks natural and performs properly. With more than eight years of local experience, we install artificial grass that stays level, drains efficiently, and remains comfortable underfoot.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Artificial grass works well in backyards, side yards, play areas, and problem spots where natural grass struggles. It reduces watering and mowing while keeping your yard clean and usable in every season.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Artificial Turf Applications
                </h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Residential Backyards and Side Yards</li>
                    <li>Pet Runs and Dog Areas</li>

                <h2>
                    Proper Base Prep and Drainage
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A solid base is the difference between turf that lasts and turf that fails early. We excavate 3-4", lay 2-3" of crusite or limestone screenings, and compact it flat with a plate compactor. Turf gets secured with 6" galvanized nails every 4-6" along edges and seams.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Turf Options and Infill Choices
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We install turf with realistic color blends and blade heights that suit how the space is used. Shorter pile works well for high-traffic areas and pet runs, while taller blades give a softer look for full backyards. Seams are aligned so the grain runs the same direction and the finish stays consistent across the yard.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Infill helps the blades stand up and adds weight to keep the turf stable. We typically use clean silica sand for a natural feel and solid drainage. If the area needs extra stability, we can add heavier infill based on the site and use.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What to Expect After Installation
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Once turf is installed, you can use the space right away. We recommend light brushing to keep the blades upright, rinsing pet areas as needed, and removing leaves or debris so drainage stays clear. We also walk the site with you to review seams, edges, and proper care.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Why Choose Serene Landscaping for Artificial Grass?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We install turf with clean seams and realistic finishes so it looks natural and performs well over time.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Proper Base Work:</strong> 3-4" excavation with compacted limestone screening.</li>
                    <li><strong>Drainage Focused:</strong> Water moves through the turf and base quickly.</li>
                    <li><strong>Clean Edges:</strong> Tight seams and crisp borders for a natural look.</li>
                    <li><strong>Low Maintenance:</strong> No mowing or watering required.</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>
                    Cost and Timing for Artificial Grass in Edmonton
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Pricing depends on square footage, site access, and whether we are removing existing grass or installing over a hard surface. Most residential projects run from about $12 to $18 per square foot installed, including base work and infill. We quote after a quick site visit so the number reflects your actual yard.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Installation typically takes one to three days once we start. We schedule around weather so the base stays dry during compaction. You can use the turf as soon as we are done; we walk you through simple care so it stays clean and drains well.
                </p>
