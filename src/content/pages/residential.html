                    Why Do Edmonton Homeowners Choose Serene Landscaping?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're a family-owned business that treats every property like our own. Here's what sets us apart from other residential landscaping companies in Edmonton:
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Quality Materials & Workmanship:</strong> We use professional-grade materials and proven installation techniques. Your patio, sod, or plantings are built to last - not just look good for the first season.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Transparent Pricing:</strong> No hidden fees or surprise charges. We provide detailed written quotes before starting any work, so you know exactly what you're paying for.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Reliable Scheduling:</strong> We show up when we say we will. If weather affects the schedule, we communicate immediately and work with you to adjust. Weekly lawn service means weekly - not whenever we get around to it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Local Expertise:</strong> We've worked with Edmonton's climate, clay soil, and freeze-thaw cycles for over 8 years. We know which plants survive here, how to prevent drainage issues, and what materials hold up to Alberta winters.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Licensed & Insured:</strong> Fully licensed, insured, and WCB covered. This protects both your property and our crew. We're not a cash-only side job - we're a legitimate business that follows proper protocols.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Satisfaction Guaranteed:</strong> We complete a final walkthrough together before considering any project done. If something isn't right, we fix it immediately at no additional cost.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>Step 2: Project Planning & Scheduling</strong><br>
                    Once you approve the quote, we schedule your project at a time that works for you. We order materials, coordinate any required permits (like final grading), and confirm the timeline.
                </p>

                    <strong>Step 3: Professional Installation</strong><br>

                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Step 4: Final Walkthrough</strong><br>
                    We walk through the completed project together. You point out any concerns, and we address them immediately. We also provide maintenance instructions so you can keep your landscape looking great.

                <h2>
                    When Is the Best Time to Start a Residential Landscaping Project in Edmonton?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    <strong>Spring (April-May):</strong> Ideal for landscape design, sod installation, garden bed creation, and drainage work. Demand is high, so book early.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Summer (June-August):</strong> Good for patios, hardscaping, and ongoing maintenance. Plants installed in summer need extra watering to establish roots.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Fall (September-October):</strong> Excellent for sod installation (cooler weather helps establishment), final grading, and preparing properties for winter.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Winter (November-March):</strong> Not ideal for most landscaping work, but we offer <a href="/services/snow-removal/">residential snow removal</a> to keep driveways and walkways clear.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For the best selection of dates and materials, we recommend booking spring projects in February or March. Summer and fall projects can often be scheduled 2-4 weeks in advance.
                </p>
