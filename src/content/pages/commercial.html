                    Why Do Property Managers Choose Serene for Commercial Landscaping?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    <strong>Reliable Scheduling:</strong> Commercial properties can't afford missed service. We show up on schedule - weekly lawn maintenance means weekly, not "whenever we get to it." If weather or circumstances require rescheduling, we communicate immediately and adjust.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Consistent Quality Across Multiple Locations:</strong> Property managers with multiple sites trust us to deliver the same quality service at every location. We maintain detailed service records and use consistent crews to ensure standards don't slip.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Flexible Scheduling to Minimize Disruption:</strong> We schedule service during off-hours, early mornings, or weekends when it won't interfere with business operations or customer traffic. For office properties, we can work around meetings or events.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Transparent Billing & Contract Pricing:</strong> No surprise charges. We provide clear seasonal or annual contracts with detailed pricing. You know exactly what you're paying for, and invoicing is straightforward and on schedule.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Licensed, Insured & WCB Covered:</strong> Full liability insurance and WCB coverage protects your property and our team. We follow proper safety protocols, especially important for high-traffic commercial sites.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Emergency Response Capability:</strong> Storm damage, unexpected snow, urgent property issues - we respond quickly. For snow removal clients, we provide 24/7 emergency service throughout winter.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Direct Communication:</strong> You work with the same account manager throughout the contract. No runaround, no phone tag - just direct communication when you need answers or adjustments.
                </p>

                <h2>
                    How Do Commercial Landscaping Contracts Work?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We offer flexible contract options designed for commercial properties:
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Seasonal Contracts (April-October):</strong> Weekly or bi-weekly lawn maintenance, spring cleanup, and fall cleanup bundled into one seasonal agreement. Predictable monthly billing makes budgeting easier.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Year-Round Contracts:</strong> Combine seasonal grounds maintenance with winter snow removal for complete property care. Single point of contact, consistent service, simplified billing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Snow Removal Contracts (November-March):</strong> Guaranteed winter service with priority response. Contract pricing provides budget certainty compared to per-push pricing during heavy snow years.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Project-Based Work:</strong> Landscape installations, parking lot improvements, seasonal plantings, or property renovations quoted on a per-project basis.
                </p>
                <p>
                    All contracts include detailed scope of work, service frequency, pricing breakdown, and clear terms. We review everything together before you commit, and contracts can be customized to your property's specific needs.
                </p>

                <h2>

                    <li><strong>Seasonal Maintenance Contract:</strong> $3,000-15,000+ for 6-month program (varies widely by property size)</li>
                    <li><strong>Snow Removal Contract:</strong> $2,000-10,000+ per season (depends on lot size, frequency triggers, salt/sand)</li>

                <h2>
                    When Should You Book Commercial Landscaping Services?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    <strong>For Seasonal Lawn Maintenance:</strong> Book in February or March to secure your preferred service schedule before spring demand peaks. Most contracts begin in April when grass starts growing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>For Snow Removal Contracts:</strong> October or early November, before the first snowfall. This ensures your property is covered when winter weather arrives. Contract slots fill up quickly.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>For Landscape Installation Projects:</strong> Book 4-8 weeks in advance for spring or summer work. Fall installation works well for certain plants and hardscaping, with less competition for scheduling.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>For Emergency or Immediate Service:</strong> We can often accommodate urgent needs within 1-2 weeks depending on current workload and season. Contact us as soon as possible if you need quick service.
                </p>
