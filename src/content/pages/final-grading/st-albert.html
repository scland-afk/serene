                </h1>
                <p>
                    Final grading here is about establishing proper drainage away from your foundation while preserving the original subdivision grading design. We complete grading that respects City of St. Albert requirements and protects long-term drainage performance.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Unlike Edmonton, the City of St. Albert does not require a final grade inspection or certificate, but grading must remain consistent with the original lot design. We shape topsoil to protect swales, avoid negative drainage, and prepare the site for sod installation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We work throughout St. Albert in areas like <strong>Erin Ridge</strong>, <strong>Jensen Lakes</strong>, and <strong>Oakmont</strong>, and we handle grading corrections when settlement or landscaping changes cause drainage problems.
                </p>

                    St. Albert Drainage Requirements
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Lot grading is designed at the subdivision level under the City’s Municipal Engineering Standards. Once rough grading is approved, responsibility shifts to the homeowner to maintain proper grading. No permit is required, but grading must stay consistent with the original lot design.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Final grading must maintain positive drainage away from foundations, preserve swales, and avoid raising grades beyond allowable limits or sending runoff onto neighboring properties.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Many lots include shared grass swales between homes or rear swales in Utility Right-of-Way areas. These swales must remain open, free of debris, and properly sloped. Blocking or altering a swale can redirect water onto adjacent properties.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Sump pump discharge must follow the City of St. Albert Surface Drainage Bylaw requirements. We grade around discharge points to prevent erosion, direct water away from the foundation, and maintain required setbacks from property lines and sidewalks.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Our Grading Process in St. Albert
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We start by reviewing the lot plan and walking the site to confirm swale locations and existing elevations. Laser levels set the target slope, then we rough grade and shape the swale lines so flow stays continuous from lot to lot.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Check elevations at the house, corners, and sidewalk</li>
                    <li>Mark high and low areas before soil placement</li>
                    <li>Place topsoil in lifts for even compaction</li>
                    <li>Shape side yards to keep water moving to swales</li>
                    <li>Fine grade by hand for a smooth, ready-for-sod finish</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>
                    Topsoil Depth and Finish
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Most residential lots need 4-6 inches of topsoil for healthy sod. We keep depth consistent so mowing stays level, and we finish about 1/2 inch above concrete edges to avoid scalping. Final passes are raked and rolled to reduce settling.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Where access is tight, we use smaller equipment and hand finishing around fences and decks. This keeps existing features intact while still getting a clean, even grade and smooth finish.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Timelines and Pricing
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Typical final grading runs 1-2 days once material is on site. Larger lots, tight access, or significant fill can extend timelines. Final grading often ranges from $1,500 to $3,500, with larger properties or heavy corrections priced higher after a site visit.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you are planning sod or hardscape, we can line up the next phase right after grading so the yard moves from prep to finish without delay.
                </p>

                    Common Final Grading Projects in St. Albert
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Most St. Albert projects involve protecting swales on new builds, correcting settlement around foundations, or fixing low spots caused by landscaping changes. Common issues include flattened side-yard swales, low spots near downspout discharge, and raised grades from excess topsoil.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Final Grading Across St. Albert Neighborhoods
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We complete final grading throughout St. Albert, including <strong>Erin Ridge</strong>, <strong>Jensen Lakes</strong>, <strong>Riverside</strong>, <strong>Oakmont</strong>, <strong>Braeside</strong>, <strong>Lacombe Park</strong>, and <strong>Sturgeon Heights</strong>. These areas include both new builds and established lots where swales and drainage paths must stay intact.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If landscaping changes have raised grades or blocked swales, we re-shape the site to restore proper flow. We also correct settlement around foundations and side yards to prevent pooling.
