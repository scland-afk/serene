                    Final grading for new homes in St. Albert, done correctly and built to protect drainage long term.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Final grading in St. Albert is about establishing proper drainage away from your foundation while preserving the original subdivision grading design. Many homeowners complete final grading after rough grade approval to prepare for sod, landscaping, and long-term property maintenance.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We provide <a href="/services/final-grading/">final grading services</a> that respect the City of St. Albert's approved drainage patterns, swales, and lot design so water continues to flow where it was intended.
                </p>

                <h2>What Final Grading Means in St. Albert</h2>
                <p>
                    In St. Albert, lot grading is designed at the subdivision level before homes are built. Each lot is assigned specific elevations, drainage directions, and swale locations as part of the City's Municipal Engineering Standards.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Unlike Edmonton, the City of St. Albert does not require a final grade inspection or certificate. Some builders still require one as part of their warranty process.</strong> Once rough grading has been approved, responsibility shifts to the homeowner to maintain proper grading.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Final grading must:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Maintain positive drainage away from the foundation</li>
                    <li>Preserve original swales and drainage paths</li>
                    <li>Avoid raising grades beyond allowable limits</li>
                    <li>Prevent runoff onto neighbouring properties</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Our role is to complete final grading that stays consistent with the approved rough grade and does not compromise drainage performance over time.
                </p>

                <h2>Common Final Grading Issues in St. Albert</h2>
                <p>
                    St. Albert homes often experience grading problems after possession due to settlement or landscaping changes. The most common issues we correct include:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Low spots near the foundation caused by soil settlement</li>
                    <li>Side yard swales being flattened or blocked</li>
                    <li>Water pooling near downspout discharge points</li>
                    <li>Raised grades from excess topsoil that disrupt drainage</li>
                    <li>Landscaping features placed inside shared swales</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Correcting these early prevents water damage and neighbour disputes.
                </p>

                <h2>Swales and Shared Drainage Responsibilities</h2>
                <p>
                    Many St. Albert lots include shared grass swales between homes or rear swales located within Utility Right-of-Way areas.
                </p>
                <p><strong>These swales must remain:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Open</li>
                    <li>Free of debris</li>
                    <li>Properly sloped</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Blocking or altering a swale can redirect water onto adjacent properties. We reshape and protect swales so drainage remains functional while still allowing you to landscape the rest of your yard safely.
                </p>

                <h2>Sump Pump Discharge and Drainage Control</h2>
                <p>
                    Sump pump discharge must follow the City of St. Albert's Surface Drainage Bylaw requirements. We grade around discharge points to:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Prevent erosion</li>
                    <li>Direct water away from the foundation</li>
                    <li>Maintain required setbacks from property lines and sidewalks</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    When storm connections are not present, splash pad grading is especially important to prevent washouts and soil movement.
                </p>

                <h2>Final Grading Pricing in St. Albert</h2>
                <p>Final grading costs depend on:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Lot size and access</li>
                    <li>Amount of settlement or regrading required</li>
                    <li>Side yard width and complexity</li>
                    <li>Existing drainage conditions</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Most final grading projects in St. Albert fall within a predictable range. We provide clear pricing after a site visit so there are no surprises.
