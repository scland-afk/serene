                <p>
                    Landscaping Sherwood Park projects are often focused upgrades in established neighborhoods like <strong>Brentwood</strong> and <strong>Lakeland Ridge</strong>. We deliver practical improvements that raise curb appeal and function without turning your yard into a long disruption.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Most projects start with lawn replacement, drainage corrections, or small patio and retaining wall upgrades. Many clients expand in phases as budget and timeline allow.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In <strong>Lakeland Ridge</strong>, <strong>Summerwood</strong>, and <strong>Brentwood</strong>, we handle refresh work that makes a clear visual and functional difference without unnecessary rebuilds.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Start Here: Sherwood Park Upgrades
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Most Sherwood Park yards do not need a full teardown. A strong first phase usually creates the biggest lift.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The best starting point is often the area you use most: lawn reset, drainage correction, or a patio and walkway refresh.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We often begin with <a href="/services/sod-installation/">sod installation</a> or <a href="/services/paving-stones/">paving stone work</a>, then sequence retaining walls, planting, or other upgrades into later phases that fit your budget.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For newer lots, we also account for Strathcona County grading requirements so elevations and drainage are ready before submission.
                </p>

                    Service Highlights
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Lawn replacement is the most common starting point. We remove failed turf when needed, correct low spots, and install sod with tight seams and clean edges. Most lawn projects run $2,500 to $6,000 depending on lot size and site conditions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <a href="/services/paving-stones/">Paving Stones in Sherwood Park</a> and <a href="/services/retaining-walls/">Retaining Walls in Sherwood Park</a> upgrade patios and walkways with proper excavation, base prep, and compaction so surfaces stay level. We also offer <a href="/services/artificial-grass/">Artificial Grass in Sherwood Park</a> and <a href="/services/fences/">Fence Installation in Sherwood Park</a> for Sherwood Park homes. Small patio upgrades typically range from $3,000 to $8,000 depending on size and materials.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Final Grading in Sherwood Park (Strathcona County)
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For new residential lots (single dwelling, semi-detached, and townhouse), Strathcona County requires grading to match the approved surface drainage plan through review of a Lot Grading Certificate.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Rough Grade is typically handled by the builder. Final Grade is the homeowner's responsibility and must be initiated within one year of rough grade approval. If that deadline is missed, fines can start at $300.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Final grade targets generally include elevations within 5 cm (2 in) of design grades (not higher), property-line slope at a minimum of 2% with no sections below 1.5%, and clear side-yard swales with at least 300 mm of unobstructed width.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <a href="/services/landscape-design/">Landscape Design in Sherwood Park</a> helps plan phased upgrades so each step finishes cleanly and fits the property.

                <p>
                    <a href="/services/lawn-maintenance/">Lawn Maintenance in Sherwood Park</a> keeps the property tidy with consistent mowing and seasonal cleanups.

                    Recent Project Examples
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Recent work includes a backyard patio and retaining wall build in Lakeland Ridge with proper drainage and sod around the perimeter, plus lawn replacement projects in Brentwood and Summerwood where older turf needed a full reset.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We serve Brentwood, Lakeland Ridge, Summerwood, and surrounding neighborhoods. These areas have larger lots with mature properties that benefit from refreshes rather than full rebuilds.
                </p>

                    Phased Upgrades That Stay Organized
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Many homeowners complete landscaping in steps, starting with lawn replacement or grading before patios and planting.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What We Bring to the Site
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We handle excavation, material delivery, and cleanup while protecting existing features like fences and decks.
                </p>

                    Project Planning for Existing Yards
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Many lots already have patios, trees, or planted beds worth keeping. We plan around what is already working.

                    Common Landscaping Projects
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The most common work is lawn replacement, patio upgrades, and walkway improvements on established lots. Some projects add retaining walls or regrade low spots to improve drainage. Typical residential projects take a few days to a couple of weeks depending on scope.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Booking and Timing in Sherwood Park
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We serve Sherwood Park year-round for lawn, hardscape, and snow removal. Spring and fall are busiest for sod and cleanups. Patio and fence work runs from spring through fall once the ground is workable. We provide a written quote after a quick site visit and can often start within one to three weeks depending on the time of year and project size.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Many Sherwood Park homeowners do one phase per season: lawn one year, patio the next. We keep the same standards on follow-up work so the property stays consistent.
                </p>

                    Quotes are in writing and include labour and materials so you can compare fairly. We do not charge for the estimate. If site conditions change, we review costs with you before adding work.
