                <p>
                    Refresh what you have, do not rebuild. That is what Sherwood Park homeowners in established neighborhoods like <strong>Brentwood</strong> and <strong>Lakeland Ridge</strong> need most. These areas have larger lots with mature properties that do not need complete overhauls. Instead, they need practical upgrades that improve function and appearance without turning the yard into a long project.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our typical path starts with lawn replacement or small hardscaping projects like patio upgrades or walkway improvements. From there, many clients expand to larger projects like complete patio renovations or full landscape upgrades. This phased approach lets you see the quality of our work before committing to bigger phases, and keeps the project manageable for your budget and timeline.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In neighborhoods like Lakeland Ridge and Summerwood, we handle lawn replacement and clean hardscape upgrades for properties that need a refresh. In more established areas like Brentwood, we focus on renovations that respect existing features while modernizing the layout and finish. Our goal is practical improvements that make a clear difference without unnecessary disruption.

                    Lawn Replacement and Resodding
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Lawn replacement is the most common starting point for Sherwood Park renovations. Many properties in Brentwood, Lakeland Ridge, and Summerwood have older lawns that need a full reset. We remove failed turf when needed, prep the base properly with grading corrections if required, and install fresh sod with tight seams and clean edges. This gives your property an immediate visual upgrade and improves how the yard functions. We provide clear aftercare guidance to protect your investment and ensure the lawn establishes properly. Most lawn replacement projects run $2,500 to $6,000 depending on lot size and site conditions.

                    Patios and Walkways
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Small hardscaping projects like patio upgrades and walkway improvements are practical starting points for Sherwood Park renovations. We design and build interlocking paver patios and walkways that flow naturally from the home and stay solid over time. Our layouts consider traffic patterns and furniture placement, then we build with proper excavation, base preparation, and compaction so surfaces stay tight and level. Many clients start with a small patio upgrade, see the quality, then expand to larger hardscaping projects later. This approach keeps the project manageable and lets you enjoy the results before committing to bigger phases.

                    Retaining Walls and Grade Corrections
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Many Sherwood Park properties have larger lots with elevation changes that need structure. Retaining walls solve grade issues, create usable space, and give the yard a more finished look. We build retaining solutions with proper engineering and quality materials to ensure long-term performance. Grade corrections improve drainage paths and create cleaner transitions between different yard areas. These structural improvements often combine with patio and walkway projects to create cohesive outdoor living spaces.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    Full landscape renovations upgrade established properties without starting from scratch. We improve bed definition, edging, rock or mulch zones, and overall layout so the yard looks intentional and stays easier to maintain. Many Sherwood Park renovations combine lawn replacement with hardscaping and planting improvements to create cohesive upgrades. Our approach respects existing features worth keeping while modernizing areas that need improvement. This keeps the project practical and focused on upgrades that make a visible difference.

                <p>
                    Many Sherwood Park homes have larger lots, mature areas, and existing features worth keeping. We plan upgrades around what is already working, then improve the areas that will make the biggest difference.
                </p>

                <p>
                    This Sherwood Park homeowner wanted to create a functional backyard space with a patio and firepit area. We installed a retaining wall to level the sloped yard, built an interlocking paver patio with integrated firepit, and finished with proper drainage and sod around the perimeter. The project transformed an unusable slope into a beautiful outdoor living space perfect for entertaining.

                <p>
                    This established Sherwood Park property needed a front yard makeover to improve curb appeal. We redesigned the landscape beds, installed clean edging, added fresh mulch and decorative rock, and selected low-maintenance plants suited for Alberta's climate. The renovation modernized the appearance while keeping maintenance simple. The result is a polished look that enhances the home's value.

                    A Sherwood Park property needed privacy fencing and yard improvements. We installed a cedar privacy fence along the property line, corrected the grade for better drainage, and completed the project with fresh sod installation. The fence provides privacy and security while the grading improvements ensure proper water flow. The finished yard is now functional, private, and well-maintained.

Many Sherwood Park properties in Lakeland Ridge, Brentwood, and Summerwood have older lawns that need a full reset, or patios that have settled and need a rebuild.

                        Yes. Sherwood Park has many larger properties, especially in areas like Brentwood and along range roads. We quote based on the real scope of work, not a quick estimate. Larger lots require more material, more labor, and better planning. We provide accurate quotes after visiting the site and measuring the work area.

                        Yes. Many Sherwood Park projects combine lawn work with patios, walkways, or retaining walls. This approach makes sense when multiple areas need work. We handle all phases of the job so you work with one contractor from start to finish. Projects typically take 1 to 3 weeks depending on scope and weather conditions.

Many Sherwood Park properties in Lakeland Ridge and Brentwood have older lawns that need a full reset, or patios that have settled and need a rebuild. Most projects run $2,500 to $8,000 depending on scope. Clients often start with one area, see the result, then expand to other services later."

This approach keeps the project manageable and lets you see the quality before committing to a full renovation. We plan each phase so it finishes cleanly and sets up the next step without paying twice for prep work. Most Sherwood Park clients prefer this staged approach."
