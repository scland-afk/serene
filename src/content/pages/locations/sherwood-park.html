                </h1>
                <p>
                    Sherwood Park homeowners in established neighborhoods like <strong>Brentwood</strong> and <strong>Lakeland Ridge</strong> typically want clean, practical upgrades without a long, drawn-out project. We focus on targeted improvements that make a clear difference while keeping the property usable.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our typical path starts with lawn replacement or small hardscaping projects like patio upgrades or walkway improvements. From there, many clients expand to larger projects like complete patio renovations or full landscape upgrades. This phased approach keeps the project manageable for budget and timeline.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In neighborhoods like <strong>Lakeland Ridge</strong>, <strong>Summerwood</strong>, and <strong>Brentwood</strong>, we handle lawn replacement and clean hardscape upgrades for properties that need a refresh. Our goal is practical improvements that make a clear difference without unnecessary disruption.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Lawn replacement is the most common starting point here. We remove failed turf when needed, correct low spots, and install sod with tight seams and clean edges. Most lawn replacement projects run $2,500 to $6,000 depending on lot size and site conditions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <a href="/services/hardscaping/">Hardscaping</a> upgrades patios and walkways with proper excavation, base prep, and compaction so surfaces stay level. Small patio upgrades typically range from $3,000 to $8,000 depending on size and materials.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <a href="/services/landscape-design/">Landscape design</a> helps plan phased upgrades so each step finishes cleanly and fits the property.

                    Recent Project Examples
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Recent work includes a backyard patio and retaining wall build in Lakeland Ridge with proper drainage and sod around the perimeter, plus lawn replacement projects in Brentwood and Summerwood where older turf needed a full reset.
                </p>

                    Neighborhood Coverage

                <p>
                    We serve Brentwood, Lakeland Ridge, Summerwood, and surrounding neighborhoods. These areas have larger lots with mature properties that benefit from refreshes rather than full rebuilds.

                    Phased Upgrades That Stay Organized
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Many homeowners complete their landscaping in steps, starting with lawn replacement or grading before patios and planting.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What We Bring to the Site

                    We handle excavation, material delivery, and cleanup while protecting existing features like fences and decks.

                <p>
                    Many lots here have patios, trees, or planted beds that need to stay. We plan around what is already working.

                    Common Landscaping Projects
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The most common work is lawn replacement, patio upgrades, and walkway improvements on established lots. Some projects add retaining walls or regrade low spots to improve drainage. Typical residential projects take a few days to a couple of weeks depending on scope.
