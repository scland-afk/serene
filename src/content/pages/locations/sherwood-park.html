                    Refresh what you have, do not rebuild. That is what Sherwood Park homeowners in established neighborhoods like <strong>Brentwood</strong>, <strong>Lakeland Ridge</strong>, and <strong>Summerwood</strong> need most. These areas have mature properties that benefit from practical upgrades.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our typical path starts with lawn replacement or small hardscaping projects like patio upgrades or walkway improvements. From there, many clients expand to larger projects like complete patio renovations or full landscape upgrades.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In neighborhoods like Lakeland Ridge, Glen Allan, and Brentwood, we handle lawn replacement and clean hardscape upgrades for properties that need a refresh. Our goal is practical improvements that make a clear difference without unnecessary disruption.
                </p>

                </h2>
                <p>
                    Sod installation is a common starting point for yard refreshes. We prep the base, correct low spots, and lay clean seams for an even finish. For new builds or regrades, we also offer final grading so the base drains correctly before sod or hardscape.

                    Recent Sherwood Park Project Examples
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Recent work includes a full lawn replacement in Westboro after a patio rebuild, a front entry walkway and step upgrade in Broadmoor, and a backyard refresh in Summerwood that combined new sod with fresh edging and river rock beds. We also completed grading corrections in Nottingham where settlement created low areas along fence lines, then installed sod once the base was corrected.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Neighborhood Coverage Across Sherwood Park
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We serve Sherwood Heights, Brentwood, Westboro, Glen Allan, Broadmoor, Nottingham, Lakeland Ridge, Regency Park, Clover Bar Ranch, and Emerald Hills. These neighborhoods include both mature lots and newer builds, so access and staging vary from property to property. We plan materials and timing so the site stays clean and organized.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Phased Upgrades That Stay Organized
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Many Sherwood Park homeowners complete their landscaping in steps. We can start with lawn replacement or grading, then return for patios, walkways, or planting beds when you are ready. Using the same crew and plan keeps each phase aligned so nothing has to be redone.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What We Bring to the Site
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our crews handle excavation, material delivery, and cleanup so the job moves smoothly. We use plate compactors for bases, laser levels for grading, and clean cut tools for pavers and edging. We protect existing features like fences and decks, then leave the site tidy at the end of each day.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Project Planning for Existing Yards
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Many Sherwood Park lots already have patios, trees, or planted beds that need to stay. We map out what stays and what changes so the new work blends cleanly into the existing yard. This keeps upgrades focused on the problem areas without tearing out everything. We also plan staging so materials do not block driveways or sidewalks.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Local Service Area Notes
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We work across Strathcona County with regular service in Sherwood Heights, Clover Bar Ranch, Foxboro, Maple Ridge, and Emerald Hills. If your property is outside these neighborhoods, we can still schedule a site visit and confirm access and scope. We also cover nearby areas like Ardrossan and North Cooking Lake by request. We can schedule evening visits as needed.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Built for Sherwood Park Properties
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Sherwood Park lots often have mature landscapes and larger yard areas. We plan upgrades around what is already working and focus on base prep and drainage so improvements last. We keep work zones compact so kids and pets still have safe access.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For many properties, a clean reset of the lawn and a simple patio update makes the biggest impact. We keep layouts practical and make sure access paths stay open, especially on lots with narrow side yards.
                </p>

                    Common Landscaping Projects in Sherwood Park
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The most common work is lawn replacement, patio upgrades, and walkway improvements on established lots. Some projects add retaining walls or regrade low spots to improve drainage. Typical residential projects take a few days to a couple of weeks depending on scope.
