                    Landscaping St Albert projects usually require compliance-focused grading and clean installation standards that protect property value. Whether you are finishing a new build in <strong>Erin Ridge</strong> or upgrading an established property in <strong>Braeside</strong> or <strong>Oakmont</strong>, we focus on durable results and clear execution.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Many St. Albert projects start with <a href="/services/final-grading/">final grading in St. Albert</a> because it prevents rework and supports local drainage requirements. From there, we install sod, then add patios and walkways when you are ready.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In newer communities like <strong>Erin Ridge</strong> and <strong>Jensen Lakes</strong>, we handle full yard completion for new construction. In established neighborhoods like <strong>Braeside</strong>, <strong>Oakmont</strong>, and <strong>Lacombe Park</strong>, <a href="/">Serene Landscaping in St. Albert</a> focuses on upgrades that improve function and curb appeal.

                <p>
                    In St. Albert, the projects that hold up best are the ones that sort out grading and drainage before the visible finish work starts.
                </p>
                <p>
                    That early prep keeps elevations clean, protects drainage paths, and avoids paying twice when sod or hardscape is installed later.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our usual flow is a site visit, <a href="/services/final-grading/">final grading in St. Albert</a>, and <a href="/services/sod-installation/">sod installation</a>, followed by patios, walkways, or retaining walls as needed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Rough grade is reviewed through the lot grading process, then ongoing drainage condition stays with the homeowner, so we plan each phase to match that reality.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    St. Albert grading relies on preserving drainage patterns and swales. We shape topsoil to protect drainage, build solid bases for hardscaping, and install sod so the lawn establishes evenly.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Final Grading in St. Albert
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In St. Albert, rough grading is reviewed through a Lot Grading Certificate, but the City does not require final lot grade certificates or final grade inspections after rough grade approval.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After rough grade is approved, the homeowner is responsible for ongoing grading maintenance. Topsoil should be applied uniformly, with a maximum depth of 6 inches, to maintain approved drainage patterns and property-line elevations.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Under Surface Drainage Bylaw 14/2015, homeowners must maintain positive drainage away from foundations toward an approved drainage facility. Discharge terminations are to be set back at least 15 cm from adjacent property lines and at least 2 m from the back of public sidewalk.
                </p>

                    Common Landscaping Projects in St. Albert
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Most St. Albert projects start with grading and sod for new builds, then move to patios, walkways, or planting upgrades. Established neighborhoods often request lawn replacement and patio refreshes. Typical residential projects take a few days to a couple of weeks depending on scope.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Booking and Timing in St. Albert
                </h2>
                <p>
                    St. Albert has specific grading and drainage expectations. We plan around them so your project passes inspection and performs over time. We typically provide a written quote within 24 hours of the site visit. Start dates depend on season and crew availability, with spring and early summer booking first for grading and sod.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We work in Erin Ridge, Jensen Lakes, Riverside, Braeside, Oakmont, and Lacombe Park. If you are on an acreage or larger lot, we factor in access and staging so the job stays organized.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What to Expect From Your Quote
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Your quote lists scope, materials, and labour with no hidden fees. If site conditions change the plan, we review options with you before extra work starts. We do not charge for the initial estimate.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Many St. Albert families prefer phased work. We break the job into logical stages so each step finishes cleanly: grading first, then sod, then patios or walkways later. This spreads costs over time and avoids long disruptions.
                </p>

                            Does St. Albert require a final lot grade inspection?

                        Rough grading is reviewed through the Lot Grading Certificate process. After rough grade approval, homeowners remain responsible for maintaining positive drainage on the lot.

                        Yes. We often keep what still works and upgrade only the weak points, such as drainage, worn lawn areas, or aging patio sections. That keeps cost and disruption under control.
