                <p>
                    St. Albert homeowners expect compliance and property value focus. Whether you are finishing a new build in <strong>Erin Ridge</strong> or upgrading an established property in <strong>Braeside</strong> or <strong>Oakmont</strong>, the standard stays the same: proper grading that meets building code, quality materials that hold up, and a finished result that enhances property value.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Many St. Albert projects start with final grading because it prevents rework and ensures compliance with local building requirements. From there, we install fresh sod to complete the basic yard, then add upgrades like patios and walkways when you are ready. This phased approach lets you finish the essentials first, see the quality of our work, then expand to additional features without paying twice for prep work.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In newer communities like Erin Ridge and Jensen Lakes, we handle final grading, sod installation, and complete yard builds for new construction. In established neighborhoods like Braeside, Oakmont, and Lacombe Park, we focus on upgrades that improve function and appearance while respecting what is already there. Our goal is clean work, correct finish, and a yard that looks right for the neighborhood.

                    Final Grading
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Final grading is essential for compliance and property value in St. Albert. Building codes require proper drainage and slope away from foundations, and getting this wrong means paying twice. We complete grading with proper elevations, correct slope, and clean transitions so sod, patios, and landscaping install correctly the first time. Our project managers shoot elevations based on your Real Property Report, ensuring code compliance and preventing future drainage issues. In areas like Erin Ridge, Braeside, and Oakmont, proper grading protects property value and sets up everything else correctly.

                    Sod Installation
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Fresh sod installation completes new build yards and gives established properties a clean reset. We install sod with proper base preparation, tight seams, and clean edges so your lawn establishes evenly and looks professional. For new builds in Erin Ridge and Jensen Lakes, sod installation follows final grading to complete the basic yard. For established properties in Braeside and Oakmont, we handle lawn replacement when existing turf is beyond repair. We provide clear aftercare guidance to protect your investment and ensure the lawn establishes properly.

                <p>
                    Patios and walkways add outdoor living space and improve property value. We build interlocking paver patios, walkways, and retaining walls with proper excavation, base preparation, and compaction. Our hardscaping features stay tight and level through Alberta winters because we do not skip steps on base work. Many St. Albert clients add patios after completing grading and sod, creating a natural progression from basic yard completion to full outdoor living. Retaining walls solve grade issues and create usable space in sloped yards.

                    Complete landscape packages combine grading, sod, hardscaping, and planting into cohesive projects. We handle everything from planning to completion, ensuring each phase finishes cleanly. For new builds in Erin Ridge and Jensen Lakes, complete packages often include final grading, sod installation, basic hardscaping, and planting. For established properties in Braeside and Oakmont, we focus on renovations that improve function and appearance without unnecessary disruption. Our approach prioritizes clean lines, proper drainage, and long-term maintenance requirements.

                <p>
                    This new St. Albert home in Erin Ridge needed a full landscape package from start to finish. We completed final grading to ensure proper drainage, installed fresh sod throughout the property, created garden beds with proper edging, and added trees, shrubs, and decorative features.

                    This new St. Albert home in Jensen Lakes needed complete yard finishing work. We started with final grading to meet building code requirements and ensure proper drainage, then installed fresh sod throughout the property.

                <p>
                    A St. Albert homeowner in Braeside wanted a unique circular patio design for their backyard. We designed and installed an interlocking paver patio with a distinctive circular pattern that creates a focal point for outdoor gatherings. The project required careful planning to maintain the circular design, proper excavation and base preparation, and precise installation techniques. The patio integrates seamlessly with the existing landscape and provides a durable, attractive surface for outdoor entertaining. The circular design adds visual interest while maintaining functionality.

                <p class="cs-item-p">
                    Yes. We regularly work in Erin Ridge, Jensen Lakes, Riverside, and other newer St. Albert communities for final grading, sod installation, and complete yard builds. Many new builds in these areas come without finished yards, so homeowners hire us to complete the grading, install sod, and add patios or walkways when ready. We understand St. Albert building code requirements and ensure proper compliance from the start. Projects typically start 2 to 4 weeks after signing the contract, depending on season and scope.

                            Why do many St. Albert projects start with grading?
                        </span>
                    </button>
                <p class="cs-item-p">
                    Because final grading ensures compliance and protects property value. St. Albert building codes require proper drainage and slope away from foundations, and getting this wrong means paying twice. Once to remove the bad work and again to do it right. Starting with professional grading means sod, patios, and landscaping install correctly the first time. Proper grading also prevents future drainage issues that can damage foundations and reduce property value. We complete grading with proper elevations and code compliance to protect your investment.

                            Can you upgrade an older St. Albert yard without rebuilding everything?

                    </button>
                <p class="cs-item-p">
                    Yes. Many St. Albert projects start with final grading and sod to complete the basic yard, then add patios, walkways, or other upgrades later. This phased approach keeps the project manageable, lets you see the quality before committing to larger phases, and fits your budget and timeline. We plan each phase so it finishes cleanly and sets up the next step without paying twice for prep work. Most St. Albert clients prefer this staged approach because it spreads costs over time and ensures each phase completes properly.

                            Yes. Patios and walkways are a common upgrade in areas like Oakmont, Jensen Lakes and Braeside. We work with homeowners to design and build patios that fit the home and are built to stay tight and level. Great for backyard living space and front entry upgrades. We provide detailed quotes after visiting your property and reviewing the work area.

                            Can work be done in phases?

                    <p class="cs-item-p">
                        Yes. Many St. Albert families prefer phased work so the project fits their timing and budget without overextending. We break the job into logical stages. Grading first, then sod, then patios or walkways later. Each phase finishes cleanly without leaving the yard torn up for months. We plan the entire project upfront so you understand the full scope before committing to anything.

Many new builds in these areas come without finished yards, so homeowners hire us to complete the grading, install sod, and add patios or walkways. Projects typically start 2 to 4 weeks after signing the contract, depending on season and scope."

            "@type": "Answer",
            "text": "Because final grading prevents rework later and sets the yard up correctly before finishing work begins. St. Albert building codes require proper drainage and slope away from your foundation. If grading is done wrong or skipped, you end up paying twice. Once to remove the bad work and again to do it right. Starting with professional grading means sod, patios, and landscaping go in clean the first time."

            "@type": "Answer",
            "text": "Yes. Many projects start with a lawn replacement or a patio upgrade, then expand from there. This approach keeps the project manageable and lets you see the quality before committing to a full renovation. We plan each phase so it finishes cleanly and sets up the next step without paying twice for prep work. Most St. Albert clients prefer this staged approach."
