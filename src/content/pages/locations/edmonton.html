                    Landscaping Edmonton homeowners need most often starts with new-build yard completion in neighborhoods like <strong>Secord</strong>, <strong>McConachie</strong>, <strong>Heritage Valley</strong>, and <strong>Windermere</strong>. New construction lots usually need final grading, sod installation, and phased hardscape work before the property is fully usable.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our typical path starts with <a href="/services/final-grading/">final grading in Edmonton</a> to meet City requirements and ensure proper drainage. From there, we install fresh sod, then add patios and walkways when you are ready. Many clients complete the full landscape package in phases, starting with essentials and expanding later.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In established neighborhoods, we handle lawn replacement, patio upgrades, and landscape renovations. Whether you are in a new development or an older area, <a href="/">Serene Landscaping in Edmonton</a> provides clear pricing and a finished result that looks right for your property.

                    Common Landscaping Projects

                <p>
                    Most projects start with final grading and sod on new builds, then add patios or planting later. Established homes often need lawn replacement, patio upgrades, or targeted drainage fixes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Most new build projects start at $3,000 to $8,000 for grading and sod. Established property renovations range from $2,500 to $15,000 depending on scope and materials. We quote each job based on actual site conditions, not package pricing.

                    Serving Edmonton as the primary service area, with St. Albert and Sherwood Park as key areas. We typically schedule site visits within a few days of your request and provide written quotes within 24 hours.

                    Booking and Timing in Edmonton
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Spring and early summer fill quickly for grading and sod. Booking in March or April helps secure preferred dates for new build work. Established yard work and patio projects can often be scheduled with a week or two of notice depending on the season. We coordinate around City of Edmonton inspection timelines when final grading is involved so your certificate is processed without delay.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Most Edmonton projects are quoted with a clear start date and a realistic duration. Weather can shift timelines; we communicate early when rain or frost affects the schedule so you are not left guessing.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Every quote includes scope, materials, and labour. You will see line items for grading, topsoil, sod, base materials, or pavers so there are no surprises. We do not charge for the initial site visit or written estimate. If the scope changes during the job, we discuss it before doing extra work.
