                    Finish your new build yard properly. That is what homeowners in newer developments like <strong>Secord</strong>, <strong>McConachie</strong>, <strong>Heritage Valley</strong>, and <strong>Windermere</strong> need most. New construction comes with unfinished yards that need final grading, sod installation, and completion before you can enjoy the property.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our typical path starts with <a href="/services/final-grading/">final grading in Edmonton</a> to meet City requirements and ensure proper drainage. From there, we install fresh sod, then add patios and walkways when you are ready. Many clients complete the full landscape package in phases, starting with essentials and expanding later.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In established neighborhoods, we handle lawn replacement, patio upgrades, and landscape renovations. Whether you are in a new development or an older area, <a href="/">Serene Landscaping in Edmonton</a> provides clear pricing and a finished result that looks right for your property.

                <p>
                    <a href="/services/final-grading/">Final grading</a> is the first step for new builds so yards pass inspection and drain correctly. We shape topsoil, protect swales, and leave the site ready for sod.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <a href="/services/sod-installation/">Sod installation</a> follows grading to finish the yard quickly. We prep the base, lay tight seams, and provide clear aftercare so lawns establish evenly.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <a href="/services/hardscaping/">Hardscaping</a> includes patios, walkways, steps, and retaining walls with solid base prep.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <a href="/services/paving-stones/">Paving stones</a> are ideal for patios and entryways. We excavate to depth, compact properly, and lock joints with polymeric sand.
                </p>

                    Recent Project Examples
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Recent work includes a full yard completion in Secord with final grading, sod, garden beds, and mulch, plus phased work in Heritage Valley where grading and sod came first and patios were added later. We also completed lawn replacement and patio upgrades in established areas once drainage was corrected.

                    Phased Builds That Stay Organized
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Many homeowners complete their yard in phases. We can start with grading and sod, then return for patios, walkways, or planting once budgets and schedules allow.
                </p>

                    Built for Local Conditions
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Local soils and drainage patterns require proper prep so grades, bases, and sod hold up season after season.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Common Landscaping Projects
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Most projects start with final grading and sod on new builds, then add patios or planting later. Established homes often need lawn replacement, patio upgrades, or targeted drainage fixes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Most new build projects start at $3,000 to $8,000 for grading and sod. Established property renovations range from $2,500 to $15,000 depending on scope and materials. We quote each job based on actual site conditions, not package pricing.
