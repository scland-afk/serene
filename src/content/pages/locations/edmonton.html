                <p>
                    Most Edmonton landscaping projects start on unfinished new-build lots in <strong>Secord</strong>, <strong>McConachie</strong>, <strong>Heritage Valley</strong>, and <strong>Windermere</strong>. These yards usually need final grading, sod installation, and phased hardscape work before they are fully usable.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our process starts with <a href="/services/final-grading/">final grading in Edmonton</a> so drainage is correct and City requirements are met, including standards under the <a href="https://www.edmonton.ca/sites/default/files/public-files/documents/Bylaws/C18093.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">City of Edmonton Drainage Bylaw 18093</a>. Then we install fresh sod and add patios or walkways in the same phase or later.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In established neighborhoods, we handle lawn replacement, patio upgrades, and targeted renovations. <a href="/">Serene Landscaping in Edmonton</a> provides clear pricing, defined scope, and clean finishing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Start Here: Edmonton Yards
                </h2>
                <p>
                    If your lot is still unfinished or your grading window is getting tight, the first priority is getting drainage and elevations right.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The biggest delays usually happen when slope and swale details are left too late, then sod or hardscape has to be redone.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We typically start with a site walk, complete <a href="/services/final-grading/">final grading in Edmonton</a>, then move into <a href="/services/sod-installation/">sod installation</a>. Patios, walkways, or retaining walls can be built in the same scope or phased in later.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Edmonton final grade approval is tied to drainage compliance, so rough-grade timing and final submission deadlines need to be planned from day one.

                    <a href="/contact/">Book an Edmonton site visit</a> and we will send a written scope with clear timing options.

                    Recent work includes a full yard completion in Secord with final grading, sod, garden beds, and mulch, plus phased work in Heritage Valley where grading and sod came first and patios were added later.

                    Many homeowners complete their yard in phases. We can start with grading and sod, then return for patios, walkways, or planting once budgets and schedules allow.

                    Local soils and drainage patterns require proper prep so grading, base work, and sod hold up season after season.

                    Common Landscaping Projects

                <p>
                    Most projects start with final grading and sod on new builds, then add patios or planting later. Established homes often need lawn replacement, patio upgrades, or targeted drainage fixes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Most new build projects start at $3,000 to $8,000 for grading and sod. Established property renovations range from $2,500 to $15,000 depending on scope and materials. We quote each job based on actual site conditions, not package pricing.

                    Booking and Timing in Edmonton
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Spring and early summer fill quickly for grading and sod. Booking in March or April helps secure preferred dates for new build work. Established yard work and patio projects can often be scheduled with a week or two of notice depending on the season. We coordinate around City of Edmonton inspection timelines when final grading is involved so your certificate is processed without delay.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In Edmonton, property owners are responsible for rough and final grade compliance, even when builders or landscapers coordinate survey work. Final grade is typically initiated within one year of rough grade approval, with additional timing limits tied to completion and permit timelines. We help keep that sequence on track.
                </p>

                    Every quote includes scope, materials, and labour. You will see line items for grading, topsoil, sod, base material, and pavers when applicable. We do not charge for the initial site visit or written estimate. If scope changes on site, we review it with you before extra work starts.

                            Can grading and sod be done in one project?
                        </span>
                    </button>
                    <p class="cs-item-p">
                        Yes. Many Edmonton clients book grading and sod together so the lot is finished in one sequence. We can also phase in patios or retaining walls later without redoing prep.

                        Spring and early summer fill fastest for grading and sod. Booking early gives you better date options, especially if you are working around City grading deadlines.
