                <p>
                    Finish your new build yard properly. That is what Edmonton homeowners in newer developments like <strong>Secord</strong>, <strong>McConachie</strong>, <strong>Heritage Valley</strong>, and <strong>Windermere</strong> need most. New construction comes with unfinished yards that need final grading, sod installation, and proper completion before you can enjoy the property. We specialize in new development work and understand what it takes to finish a yard right the first time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our typical path starts with final grading to meet building code requirements and ensure proper drainage. From there, we install fresh sod throughout the property, then add patios and walkways when you are ready. Many clients complete the full landscape package in phases, starting with the essentials and expanding later. This approach lets you move in with a finished yard, then add outdoor living features when the budget allows.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In established Edmonton neighborhoods, we handle lawn replacement, patio upgrades, and landscape renovations. Whether you are in a new development or an older area, we provide clear pricing, professional work, and a finished result that looks right for your property. Call (587) 566-9879 for a free site visit and quote.

                <h2>
                    Final Grading in Edmonton
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Final grading is the foundation of every new build yard. In areas like Secord, McConachie, and Heritage Valley, we complete grading to meet building code requirements and ensure proper drainage away from your foundation. Our project managers shoot elevations based on your Real Property Report, saving you money by avoiding third-party surveyor costs. We work on both greenfield and infill projects and understand the new infill final grade requirements. Proper grading prevents rework later and sets everything up correctly before sod, patios, and landscaping go in. We guarantee final grade approval because we know what inspectors are looking for and how to ensure your grade will pass inspection.

                    Sod Installation and Lawn Maintenance in Edmonton
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Fresh sod installation completes the new build yard and gives established properties a clean reset. We install sod with proper base preparation, tight seams, and clean edges so your lawn establishes evenly and looks professional from day one. Unlike many landscape companies, we complete the entire project before final grade inspection to save you time and money. This ensures your property drains correctly even after the project is finished, and lets your family start enjoying the yard sooner. We also offer ongoing lawn maintenance programs for homeowners and commercial properties throughout Edmonton, including weekly mowing, seasonal cleanups, and turf care.

                    Patios and Hardscaping in Edmonton
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Patios and walkways transform unfinished yards into outdoor living spaces. We design and build interlocking paver patios, walkways, steps, and retaining walls with proper excavation, base preparation, and compaction. Our hardscaping features stay tight and level through Alberta freeze-thaw cycles because we do not cut corners on base work. Many Edmonton clients add patios after completing grading and sod, creating a natural progression from basic yard completion to full outdoor living. We work with quality materials and proven installation techniques to ensure your hardscaping lasts for years.

                <p>
                    Full landscape packages combine grading, sod, hardscaping, and planting into one cohesive project. We handle everything from initial planning to final walkthrough, ensuring each phase completes cleanly and sets up the next step correctly. For new builds in Windermere, Secord, and McConachie, complete packages often include final grading, sod installation, patio or walkway construction, and basic planting. For established properties, we focus on renovations that improve function and appearance without unnecessary disruption. Our design approach prioritizes practical layouts, proper drainage, and long-term maintenance requirements.

                    In new developments like Secord, McConachie, Heritage Valley, and Windermere, final grading and sod installation are the most common projects. These areas have many new builds with unfinished yards that need proper completion. In established neighborhoods, lawn replacement, patio upgrades, and landscape renovations are typical. We quote each job based on actual scope and site conditions, not package pricing. Most new build projects start at $3,000 to $8,000 for grading and sod, while established property renovations range from $2,500 to $15,000 depending on scope.

Larger builds and hardscaping require planning, material ordering, and crew scheduling, typically 2 to 4 weeks out. We provide a realistic start window after the site visit so you can plan accordingly. Rush jobs may be available depending on current workload."
