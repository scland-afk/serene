                <span class="cs-topper">What We Value</span>
                <h2 class="cs-title">Why Homeowners and Businesses Choose Serene Landscaping</h2>
                
                <h3>Quality Workmanship</h3>
                <p>We use professional-grade materials and proven installation techniques. Every project is completed to industry standards with attention to detail that shows in the finished result. We don't cut corners, and we don't rush - your property deserves better than that.</p>

                <h3>Fair & Transparent Pricing</h3>
                <p>No hidden fees, no surprise charges. We provide detailed written quotes that clearly explain what's included, what materials will be used, and what the timeline looks like. You'll know exactly what you're paying for before we start.</p>

                <h3>Reliable Scheduling</h3>
                <p>We show up when we say we will. If weather or other factors affect the schedule, we communicate immediately and work with you to adjust. For commercial clients, we understand that consistent service matters - weekly lawn maintenance means weekly, not "whenever we get to it."</p>

                <h3>Local Expertise</h3>
                <p>We've worked with Edmonton's climate, clay soil, spring runoff challenges, and freeze-thaw cycles for over a decade. We know which plants survive here, how to prevent drainage issues, and what hardscaping materials hold up to Alberta winters.</p>

                <h3>Licensed & Insured</h3>
                <p>Fully licensed, insured, and WCB covered for your protection and peace of mind. This isn't a side job or a weekend operation - we're a legitimate business that follows proper safety protocols and industry regulations.</p>

                <h3>Customer Satisfaction</h3>
                <p>We're not satisfied until you're satisfied. After completing each project, we walk through everything together. If something isn't right, we address it immediately. Our 5-star Google reviews and repeat customers speak to this commitment.</p>

                            What if I'm not satisfied with the work?

                        We complete a final walkthrough together before considering any project complete. If something isn't right, we address it immediately at no additional cost. We're not satisfied until you're satisfied - that's our guarantee.

                            Do you offer maintenance after installation?

                        Yes. Many of our landscape design clients transition to ongoing lawn maintenance programs after their project is complete. After all, who better to maintain your landscaping than the team that installed it? We offer weekly, bi-weekly, and seasonal maintenance options.
