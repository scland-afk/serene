                <span class="cs-topper">What We Value</span>
                <h2 class="cs-title">Why Homeowners and Businesses Choose Serene Landscaping</h2>
                
                <h3>Work Built to Last</h3>
                <p>We build landscapes the same way we would on our own property. Proper base preparation, correct grading, and clean finishing details matter in Alberta’s climate. Our work is planned for drainage, durability, and a finished look that holds up season after season.</p>

                <h3>Clear Quotes, No Guesswork</h3>
                <p>We quote the work in writing and keep it straightforward. You will know what is included, what materials are being used, and what the expected timeline looks like. If scope changes, we talk through it first so there are no surprises.</p>

                <h3>Respect for Your Schedule</h3>
                <p>We plan the job, show up as scheduled, and keep the site organized. When weather affects the timeline, we communicate early and adjust with you. For commercial clients, scheduled service stays consistent because reliability is part of the service."</p>

                <h3>Edmonton-Area Know-How</h3>
                <p>Our work is tailored to local conditions like clay soil, spring runoff, and freeze-thaw cycles. We focus on solutions that make sense here, from grading and drainage to hardscape materials and installation methods that perform in Edmonton winters.</p>

                <h3>Proper Coverage and Safety</h3>
                <p>We are licensed, insured, and WCB covered. That protects your property and our crew, and it reflects a professional operation that follows safe work practices and industry standards.</p>

                <h3>Final Walkthrough and Accountability</h3>
                <p>We finish each project with a walkthrough and confirm everything matches the agreed scope. If something needs attention, we address it promptly. That is how we earn repeat work and long-term clients.</p>

                            Do you offer maintenance after installation?

                        Yes. Many of our landscape design clients transition to ongoing lawn maintenance programs after their project is complete. After all, who better to maintain your landscaping than the team that installed it? We offer weekly, bi-weekly, and seasonal maintenance options.
