### Final Grading Requirements for New Construction in Edmonton

Bought a new construction home in Edmonton? Final grading is required before you can get an occupancy permit—but many new homeowners don't understand what it involves, when it needs to happen, or what it costs.

Here's everything Edmonton homeowners need to know about final grading requirements, the process, typical costs, and how to ensure compliance with City of Edmonton regulations.

#### What Is Final Grading?

Final grading is the process of shaping and grading your property to specific slopes and elevations required by the City of Edmonton. It ensures proper drainage away from your foundation, prevents basement flooding, and creates a safe, functional yard.

**What final grading includes:**
- Grading soil to proper slope (minimum 2% away from foundation)
- Bringing property to required finish elevations
- Creating positive drainage patterns
- Preparing site for sod or landscaping
- Installing minimum 4-6 inches of topsoil
- Obtaining a grading certificate from the City

Without final grading, you cannot get your occupancy permit—meaning you can't legally move into your new home.

#### Why Is Final Grading Required in Edmonton?

The City of Edmonton requires final grading for every new construction property to:

**1. Protect foundations:** Proper grading directs water away from basements, preventing moisture intrusion and foundation damage.

**2. Prevent flooding:** Correct slopes ensure runoff flows to streets and storm sewers instead of pooling on properties or flowing toward neighbors.

**3. Meet safety standards:** Proper grading prevents trip hazards, erosion, and drainage issues that affect public safety.

**4. Maintain neighborhood drainage:** Each property must drain properly to prevent affecting adjacent properties.

The City won't issue an occupancy permit until final grading is complete and inspected. This protects you, your neighbors, and the long-term integrity of your neighborhood.

#### When Does Final Grading Need to Happen?

**Timeline:**
- Home construction completes: Spring/Summer
- Final grading: Before occupancy permit issued
- Typical window: May through October

**Seasonal restrictions:**

Final grading can only happen when:
- Ground isn't frozen
- Weather allows proper grading and compaction
- Typically May through October in Edmonton

**If your home completes in fall/winter:**
- Final grading may need to wait until spring
- Temporary occupancy permits may be available (check with City)
- You may need temporary drainage measures over winter

Most builders complete final grading in the warmer months when ground conditions allow proper soil work.

#### Final Grading Cost in Edmonton

**Typical costs for residential properties:**
- Small lot (25-30 feet wide): $2,000-$4,000
- Medium lot (30-40 feet wide): $3,000-$6,000
- Large lot (40-50 feet wide): $4,000-$8,000
- Extra large/corner lots: $6,000-$12,000+

**What's included:**
- Grading to required slopes
- 4-6 inches of topsoil
- Rough grade preparation
- As-built survey (grading certificate)
- City of Edmonton submission and approval

**Additional costs if needed:**
- Extra topsoil (if insufficient soil on site): $200-$1,000+
- Drainage corrections: $500-$3,000
- Retaining walls (for severe slopes): $3,000-$10,000+
- Tree/shrub removal: $200-$1,000

Many new construction homes have final grading included in the purchase price, but verify this with your builder. If not included, you're responsible for arranging and paying for it.

#### Who Handles Final Grading?

**Three options:**

**1. Builder includes it** (most common):
- Final grading is part of home purchase
- Builder hires contractor and handles process
- You typically only choose sod vs. seed

**2. Builder requires you to arrange it:**
- You hire and pay final grading contractor
- Responsible for obtaining grading certificate
- Must complete before occupancy permit issued

**3. You handle it yourself** (DIY):
- Not recommended unless you have experience
- Requires proper equipment (skid steer, laser level)
- Must meet City requirements
- Still need professional survey for certification

Most homeowners hire professional <a href="/services/final-grading/">final grading services</a> to ensure proper slope, drainage, and City approval.

#### Final Grading Process and Timeline

**Step 1: Initial rough grade** (often done during construction)
- Builder grades lot to approximate final elevations
- Creates basic drainage patterns
- May sit for weeks/months before final grade

**Step 2: Final grade preparation**
- Spread topsoil (minimum 4-6 inches)
- Grade to exact slopes and elevations
- Create positive drainage away from foundation
- Ensure proper drainage to streets/storm sewers

**Step 3: Grading certificate (As-Built Survey)**
- Professional surveyor measures actual final grades
- Compares measurements to approved grading plan
- Submits report to City of Edmonton
- City reviews and approves

**Step 4: City inspection and approval**
- City inspector may visit site
- Reviews as-built survey
- Issues approval if grading meets requirements
- Allows occupancy permit to proceed

**Typical timeline:** 1-3 days for grading work, 7-14 days for survey and City approval

#### Required Grading Specifications in Edmonton

**Minimum slope requirements:**

**Away from foundation:**
- Minimum 2% slope (2 feet of fall per 100 feet)
- Preferred 5% slope for first 10 feet
- Measured for minimum 10 feet from foundation

**Toward drainage:**
- Property must drain to street or lane
- No ponding water allowed
- No drainage toward neighboring properties

**Topsoil depth:**
- Minimum 4 inches (required)
- 6 inches preferred for healthy grass growth
- Must be quality topsoil, not clay or fill

#### Common Final Grading Problems

**1. Insufficient slope**
- Water pools near foundation
- Basement moisture issues
- Won't pass City inspection

**Solution:** Regrade with additional soil, create positive drainage

**2. Grading toward neighbor's property**
- Violates City regulations
- Can cause neighbor disputes
- Requires correction before approval

**Solution:** Adjust grades to direct water properly

**3. Inadequate topsoil**
- Won't support healthy grass
- Poor growing conditions
- May settle significantly

**Solution:** Add quality topsoil to minimum 6 inches

**4. Ponding water**
- Low spots collect water
- Creates mud and dead grass
- Won't pass inspection

**Solution:** Fill low spots, improve drainage patterns

**5. Erosion issues**
- Steep slopes erode in rain
- Soil washes away
- Damages new sod

**Solution:** Reduce slope steepness, add sod quickly, consider erosion control measures

Quality contractors prevent these problems by following City specifications and using proper grading techniques.

#### Sod vs. Seed After Final Grading

After final grading, you need to establish grass to hold soil and complete your yard.

**Sod:**
- Instant lawn
- Prevents erosion immediately
- More expensive ($1.50-$3.00 per sq ft installed)
- Best timing: May-June or September in Edmonton
- Preferred option for most new construction

**Seed:**
- Much cheaper ($0.10-$0.30 per sq ft)
- Takes weeks to establish
- Vulnerable to erosion until established
- Must stay off lawn for weeks
- Limited success in Edmonton's clay soil

Most Edmonton homeowners choose sod after final grading. It prevents erosion, looks great immediately, and establishes quickly. We offer <a href="/services/landscape-design/">sod installation services</a> specifically for new construction properties.

#### How to Choose a Final Grading Contractor

**Questions to ask:**

1. Are you licensed and insured?
2. How many final grading projects have you completed in Edmonton?
3. Do you include the as-built survey and City submission?
4. What's your timeline for completion?
5. What warranty do you provide?
6. What's included in your quote (topsoil depth, drainage work)?

8. How do you handle drainage issues if they arise?

**Red flags:**
- Significantly lower pricing than other quotes (cutting corners)
- No insurance or licensing
- Won't commit to timeline

#### What Happens If Grading Fails Inspection?

If City of Edmonton rejects your final grading:

**1. City issues deficiency notice**

- Provides timeline for corrections

**2. Contractor corrects issues**
- Adjusts slopes or drainage
- Adds topsoil if needed
- Addresses specific deficiencies

**3. New survey and resubmission**

- City reviews again

**4. Re-inspection and approval**

- Issues approval if satisfied

**Cost impact:** Corrections typically add $500-$2,000 depending on issues. Quality contractors guarantee their work and fix deficiencies at no cost to homeowners.
