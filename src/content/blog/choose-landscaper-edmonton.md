### How to Choose a Landscaper in Edmonton: Complete Hiring Guide

Hiring the right landscaper makes the difference between a beautiful outdoor space you enjoy for years and a disappointing project that requires expensive repairs. With dozens of landscaping companies operating in Edmonton, how do you separate quality contractors from those who will cause problems?

Here's what Edmonton homeowners should know about choosing a landscaper, what questions to ask, red flags to watch for, and how to ensure you hire someone trustworthy and skilled.

#### Start with Clear Project Goals

Before contacting landscapers, define what you want to accomplish:

**Simple projects:**
- Weekly lawn mowing
- Spring or fall cleanup
- Seasonal flower planting

**Medium complexity:**
- Garden bed installation
- Sod installation
- Basic patio or walkway
- Tree/shrub planting

**Complex projects:**
- Complete landscape design and installation
- Large hardscaping (patios, retaining walls, outdoor kitchens)
- Drainage solutions
- Multi-phase landscape projects

Different landscapers specialize in different services. Lawn care companies excel at maintenance but may not handle complex <a href="/services/hardscaping/">hardscaping projects</a>. Full-service landscaping companies handle design, installation, and maintenance.

Match your project to a contractor with relevant experience.

#### Get Multiple Quotes (But Not Too Many)

**Ideal number of quotes: 3-5**

**Why multiple quotes:**
- Compare pricing and approach
- Understand market rates
- Identify outliers (too high or suspiciously low)
- Get different design perspectives

**Why not more than 5:**
- Diminishing returns on information
- Time-consuming for you
- Disrespectful of contractors' time if you're not serious

**When requesting quotes, provide:**
- Clear project description
- Approximate budget range
- Timeline expectations
- Photos if possible
- Property measurements

Detailed information helps contractors provide accurate quotes instead of rough estimates that change later.

#### Essential Questions to Ask Every Landscaper

**1. Are you licensed and insured?**

This should be your first question. Licensed contractors follow regulations. Insurance protects you if workers are injured or property is damaged.

**What to verify:**
- Business license (City of Edmonton or provincial)
- Liability insurance (minimum $2 million recommended)
- WCB (Workers' Compensation Board) coverage

**Red flag:** Contractor hesitates or can't provide proof of insurance

**2. How long have you been in business?**

Experience matters in landscaping. Contractors learn through years of projects, problem-solving, and working with Edmonton's climate.

**What to look for:**
- Minimum 3-5 years for complex projects
- 1-2 years acceptable for simple lawn maintenance
- Established business with track record

**Red flag:** Brand new company taking on complex installations

**3. Can I see photos of similar projects?**

Quality landscapers maintain portfolios of completed work. Photos show their skill level, attention to detail, and design aesthetic.

**What to review:**
- Projects similar to yours
- Before and after photos
- Variety of work (if full-service company)
- Quality of finished work

**Red flag:** No photos available or only shows few projects

**4. Do you provide references?**

Talking to past customers reveals how contractors handle communication, timelines, problems, and customer satisfaction.

**What to ask references:**
- Was the project completed on time?
- Did the contractor communicate clearly?
- How did they handle any problems that arose?
- Was the final cost close to the estimate?
- Would you hire them again?
- Any concerns or issues?

**Red flag:** Contractor won't provide references or references give lukewarm feedback

**5. What's your process from quote to completion?**

Understanding the process helps set expectations and reveals professionalism level.

**What quality contractors explain:**
- Initial consultation and quote process
- Design phase (if applicable)
- Timeline and scheduling
- How they handle weather delays
- Daily cleanup procedures
- Final walkthrough and approval

**Red flag:** Vague answers or no clear process

**6. What warranty do you offer?**

Warranties demonstrate confidence in workmanship and materials.

**Typical warranties:**
- Labor: 1-2 years
- Plants: 1 growing season
- Sod: 30 days to 1 year
- Hardscaping: 2-5 years

**What warranties should cover:**
- Workmanship defects
- Material failures
- Installation errors
- Normal settling (for hardscaping)

**Red flag:** No warranty offered or extremely short warranty period

**7. What's included in your quote?**

Detailed quotes prevent surprise costs later.

**Quote should include:**
- Specific materials (brands, types, quantities)
- Labor costs
- Equipment rental if needed
- Disposal fees
- Permits (if required)
- Timeline
- Payment schedule

**Red flag:** Vague "all-inclusive" quotes without detail

**8. Who will actually do the work?**

Some companies use subcontractors. Others use in-house crews.

**What to ask:**
- Will you (the owner) be on site?
- Do you use employees or subcontractors?
- How do you ensure quality control?
- Who should I contact with questions during the project?

**Red flag:** Company owner never visits job sites or has no quality control process

**9. How do you handle changes or problems?**

Problems happen. How contractors handle them reveals their professionalism.

**What quality contractors say:**
- "We communicate immediately if issues arise"
- "We provide solutions and options"
- "We don't proceed with changes without your approval"
- "We document everything in writing"

**Red flag:** "We'll handle it" with no specifics

#### Red Flags When Choosing a Landscaper

**Major red flags (avoid these contractors):**

#### Questions to Ask Yourself Before Hiring

Trust your instincts. If something feels off, it probably is.

**2. Do they seem knowledgeable about my project?**
Quality contractors ask questions, offer suggestions, and explain their approach.

**3. Am I comfortable with their communication style?**
You'll communicate throughout the project. Choose someone you're comfortable talking to.

**4. Does their timeline align with my needs?**
If you need work done by a specific date, ensure the contractor can commit.

**5. Is the price fair for the value?**
Cheapest isn't always best. Focus on value: quality materials, skilled labor, warranties, and peace of mind.

#### When to Walk Away

Don't hire a landscaper if:
- They can't or won't provide insurance proof
- They pressure you to sign immediately
- Price is dramatically lower than competitors
- They won't provide references
- Online reviews are consistently negative
- Your instincts say something is wrong
- They want huge upfront payment
- No written contract offered

It's better to keep looking than hire the wrong contractor.

#### FAQ: Choosing a Landscaper in Edmonton

**Q: How much should I pay upfront to a landscaper?**
A: Quality contractors use progressive payments only, with payments tied to project milestones. Be cautious of contractors requesting 50%+ upfront, especially for large projects.

**Q: Should I choose the cheapest landscaper?**
A: Not necessarily. Significantly low prices often mean cut corners, inferior materials, or hidden costs later. Focus on value and quality, not just price.

**Q: How do I verify a landscaper's insurance?**
A: Ask for a Certificate of Insurance directly from their insurance company. Verify it's current and covers adequate liability amounts ($2 million minimum recommended).

**Q: What if the landscaper I want is booked for months?**
A: Quality contractors often book months ahead, especially in spring/summer. Book early or ask about their cancellation list. Avoid contractors with immediate availability during peak season - it may indicate quality issues.

**Q: Should I hire a full-service landscaping company or specialist?**
A: For simple lawn care, specialists are fine. For complex projects involving design, hardscaping, and plantings, full-service companies like <a href="/services/landscape-design/">Serene Landscaping</a> handle everything without coordinating multiple contractors.

**Q: What's a reasonable timeline for a landscaping project?**
A: Simple projects (lawn care, cleanup): 1-3 days. Medium projects (sod, small patio): 3-7 days. Large projects (complete landscapes, large patios): 1-4 weeks. Timeline depends on scope and weather.

**Q: How important are online reviews?**
A: Very important. Check Google, Facebook, and Better Business Bureau. Look for patterns. One or two negative reviews among dozens of positive is normal. Consistently poor reviews are red flags.

**Q: Can I negotiate price with landscapers?**
A: Reasonable negotiation on price is acceptable, but demanding dramatic discounts often results in cut corners. Instead, ask what can be removed from scope to lower price.
