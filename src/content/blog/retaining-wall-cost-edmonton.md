#### Factors Affecting Retaining Wall Cost

**1. Wall Height**

Wall height dramatically affects cost:

**Low walls (2-3 feet):**
- Simpler construction
- Minimal engineering required
- Lower material and labor costs
- $25-$50 per linear foot

**Medium walls (4-5 feet):**
- May require engineering
- Geogrid reinforcement needed
- More complex drainage
- $50-$100 per linear foot

**Tall walls (6+ feet):**
- Engineering required
- Permits needed
- Complex installation
- Significant drainage needs
- $100-$200+ per linear foot

**2. Wall Length**

Longer walls cost more total but may have lower per-foot pricing due to economies of scale.

**3. Site Conditions**

**Easy sites:**
- Level access for equipment
- Good soil conditions
- Minimal excavation needed
- No existing structures to work around

**Difficult sites:**
- Poor soil requiring excavation and replacement
- Limited equipment access (backyard only, no gate)
- Slopes requiring terracing
- Existing utilities to work around
- Rocky soil

Difficult sites can add 30-50% to project cost.

**4. Drainage Requirements**

All retaining walls need drainage to prevent:
- Water pressure buildup behind wall
- Frost heave
- Wall failure

**Drainage costs include:**
- Drainage pipe (weeping tile): $5-$10 per linear foot
- Drain rock: $50-$150 total
- French drains if needed: $1,000-$3,000

Poor drainage is the #1 cause of retaining wall failure in Edmonton.

**5. Permits and Engineering**

**City of Edmonton requirements:**

**Walls 4 feet or under:** Usually no permit required (verify with City)
**Walls over 4 feet:** Require engineering and permits

**Engineering costs:**
- Structural engineer consultation: $500-$1,500

#### DIY vs. Professional Installation

**DIY makes sense for:**

- Non-critical applications
- You have experience and proper tools

**Hire professionals for:**

#### Retaining Wall Lifespan

**Expected lifespans:**

**Treated timber:** 10-15 years
**Concrete blocks:** 30-50 years  
**Natural stone:** 50-100+ years
**Poured concrete:** 50+ years
**Boulders:** 100+ years

Lifespan depends heavily on:
- Quality of installation
- Proper drainage
- Base preparation
- Ongoing maintenance
- Edmonton's freeze-thaw cycles

#### Retaining Wall Maintenance

**Annual tasks:**
- Inspect for cracks, bulging, or leaning
- Clear drainage outlets
- Fill settled areas behind wall

- Repair minor issues promptly

**Every 3-5 years:**

Well-maintained walls last decades. Ignored problems lead to expensive repairs or replacement.

#### FAQ: Retaining Walls in Edmonton

**Q: How much does a retaining wall cost in Edmonton?**

A: Average costs range from $25-$50 per linear foot for treated timber to $100-$200+ per linear foot for boulder walls. Typical projects range from $1,500 for small garden walls to $25,000+ for large structural walls.

**Q: Do I need a permit for a retaining wall in Edmonton?**

A: Walls 4 feet or under typically don't require permits, but walls over 4 feet require engineering and City of Edmonton permits. Always verify current requirements with the City.

**Q: What's the best material for retaining walls in Edmonton?**

A: Concrete retaining blocks (Allan Block, Versa-Lok) offer the best balance of durability, cost, and freeze-thaw resistance for most Edmonton applications. Natural stone is premium but costly. Timber works for low walls but has shorter lifespan.

**Q: How long do retaining walls last?**

A: Timber: 10-15 years. Concrete blocks: 30-50 years. Natural stone: 50-100+ years. Lifespan depends heavily on installation quality and proper drainage.

**Q: Can I install a retaining wall myself?**

A: Small walls (under 2 feet) can be DIY projects. Walls over 3 feet should be professionally installed. Poor installation leads to wall failure, property damage, and expensive repairs.

**Q: What causes retaining walls to fail?**

A: Poor drainage is the #1 cause. Water pressure builds up behind walls without proper drainage, leading to failure. Other causes include inadequate base preparation, incorrect installation, and using wrong materials for wall height.

**Q: Do retaining walls need drainage?**

A: Yes, all retaining walls need drainage systems (weeping tile, drain rock) to prevent water pressure buildup. Without drainage, walls fail during freeze-thaw cycles.

**Q: How tall can a retaining wall be without engineering?**

A: In Edmonton, walls 4 feet or under typically don't require engineering. Walls over 4 feet require structural engineering and permits.
